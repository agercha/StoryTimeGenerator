Tana hi so I asked you guys on Twitter today if you wanted to see a stalker like update like the finale to my stalker series or if you wanted to see a back to school haul and I literally don't even think one single person was like yeah I want to see you back to school every single person was like  are you [ __ ] kidding me like what the [ __ ] do you think we want to see and I was like [ __ ] I'm so sorry I asked, I'll film a stalker update and Here I am filming a stalker update so if you haven't seen my creepy stalker story this video is going to make zero sense too I mean like literally zero so I would go ahead and watch that before you watch this and I'll link that in the downbar below but most of you are caught up because all  you guys ever asked for is stalker  updates so yeah yeah I don't know let's  just my nose itches now it's running  that's hot  so I posted just [ __ ] okay so a couple  months ago I posted a video about my  stalker who's been stalking me since  second grade and before I posted that  video I was only getting like five or  six thousand views on a video so I  assumed that by posting that I was only  gonna get five or six thousand life  would go on nobody would really care it  wouldn't blow up and then the video got  , and I was like well [ __ ] my  stalker is gonna find out and [ __ ]  kill me so so I posted that video and  everything was fine and when it hit like  the , mark people started asking  me about it all the time like every  comment on my Instagram became like  what's your stalkers Instagram who's  your stalker like your stalkers gonna be  mad about this like oh my god like I  wonder if he sees my comment right now  with all this stuff and I suck at  English so this girl DM me once I had  like a hundred thousand views on the  video she DM me and she was like hey is  your stalkers name blank and she like  put his name and I was like yeah like  how do you know that because I didn't  tell it in the video I haven't like said  his Instagram name or anything like how  would you know his name like she said  his full name like first and last name  and I was like so how do you know that  and then she was like oh I dated him for  a year and we broke up because he was  obsessed with you and I was like cool  nice to meet you  good [ __ ] like great that's what I  wanted to [ __ ] hear and then yeah  like that's all that really happened  about that but then I started getting  all of these anonymous messages on  tumblr and the first message was my  address but they they like made a riddle  out of it and the answer to the riddle  was like my address and I was like what  the [ __ ] so I was with friends when I  hoped that so I called my dad and I was  like hey dad like somebody just  anonymously messaged us like my address  on tumblr like what the [ __ ] and while  I'm on the phone with my dad I get a  message that is my dad's full name like  first middle and last name and I was  like this is so sketch like what the  [ __ ] and so I stay on the phone with him  and I'm like you know what I think I'm  gonna go visit my grandma and I'm not  gonna say where she lives but she lives  in another state and I was going to go  visit her to get out of town for a  little bit and like lay low so I didn't  die because my stalker was really  sketching me out and after I said that  on the phone my stalker  or whoever sends me a message on tumblr  that was my grandma's phone home phone  number in like three messages and I was  like are you [ __ ] kidding me like are  you kidding me like really like really  and so I was with a friend that looks  great  well it's so good pop your [ __ ]  collar this is  wonderful so I was  with a friend at the time and all this  was happening who was like one of my  close friends and I was like freaking  the [ __ ] out him like what am I gonna do  like I need to leave the country like I  can't do this right now like this is not  okay I'm freaking out and he was like  calm down like you're overreacting like  it's okay like everything's gonna be  okay and I'm like no it's [ __ ] on I'm  in a [ __ ] dog whatever he's a  you're being a drama queen like it's  alright like someone's just [ __ ] with  you it's probably one of your friends  I'm you know and so while I was freaking  out and talking to him we were sitting  in the car in front of a Liberty Mutual  Insurance but we were both like unaware  of that at the time you know we were  waiting to pick up our friend and so I  get a message that says Liberty Mutual  Insurance and I'm like what is this mean  like I don't get it and so I show him  and he's like I don't get it either and  we both look up and there's the biggest  [ __ ] Liberty Mutual Insurance sign  directly in front of our Carling  directly in front of our car we won't  look at each other I still roll my phone  I'm like I'm done with this [ __ ] [ __ ]  [ __ ] out all iPhone like I don't need  it like I'm done and he's like I'm sorry  you're not being the drama queen I  forgive you and I was like yeah [ __ ]  yeah I also forgot to mention while  filming that the entire time this was  happening I was telling my best friend  whom I'm really close with that I was  freaking out because I was being stalked  and I called her to tell her this and  then all of a sudden she was driving to  my house or like where we were to meet  up with us to talk about this and all of  a sudden while she was driving to meet  up with us a car starts following her  and she calls me after like five minutes  I've been following her and it's like  hey like this car is following me I'm  freaking out and as soon as uhm she  calls me to tell me that the car that's  following her pulls up next to her rolls  up his window all the way slides down in  the seat to where she can't see his face  puts his hand up and waves at her like  super creepy like slow waves and then  just drives away and then I call my mom  to say like hey lock the front door  because our friend like she's getting  followed by a car right now he could be  coming to the house and my mom goes oh  that car that he was just outside of our  house taking pictures I thought it was  our neighbor and I was like what the  [ __ ] and I totally forgot to enter that  part so I'm doing that now because Pro  youtuber up in this [ __ ] yeah and then  so that night me and all of my friends  were supposed to go camping and it was  like for our friend's birthday like they  wanted to go up camping and like we all  just hang out all together  that's what they wanted to do so we're  like okay let's go camping so all day I  was freaking out about my stalker you  know like just kind of on edge and so I  made every single person I was with like  there was like  of us going camping I  mean every single person take their  phone turn their location services off  like turn anything they could track them  off and turn their phone off and put  them all in one car because we were  driving them like five cars so we all  drive up to the mountains to go camping  and all of our phones are off the whole  night like nobody could track us you  know what I mean we camp we have a great  time in the morning we all wake up and  we go home and once I get home my  stalker sends me a message that is like  a list and the list is says like pink  beanie  yellow flannel gray shirt blue hoodie  black hoodie like a long ass list of  like clothing items and I'm still with  my close friend and I'm like hey like  look at this like what does this mean  obviously it's for my stalker but like  like what I don't get it and he's like  wasn't like blank except on my friends  names like wasn't she wearing a pink  beanie last night and I was like yeah  and then I was like weren't you wearing  a black hoodie I was wearing a tarda  hoodie like Maya was wearing a gray tank  top like and then everything decided I'd  like the whole list was a list of like  every single person who went camping  like outfit and I was like Jesus take  the [ __ ] wheel jesus take the  wheel right now like please take the  wheel because I'm going to [ __ ] die  like I'm gonna die this is when the  stalker thing to me wasn't funny anymore  it wasn't a [ __ ] joke like I didn't  find it like this funny little thing  anymore like I was [ __ ] scared I was  crying like all the time like a sketch  sketch like this it wasn't funny like it  was not funny anymore this was the point  where I was like I quit YouTube like I'm  done like this is this is enough like  enough and so the stalker chilled out  for a couple hours and we were driving  and this message still perplexes the  living [ __ ] out of me  creeps me out and I just talking about  I've chilled I goosebumps look at my  goosebumps let's just any  so we're driving and I get a message  that says hey Tana your fourth toe is  blank and I was like so [ __ ] like this  is obviously someone [ __ ] with me and  so I'm like my photo is blank like I  don't get it like I don't get it and so  I look at all my toes and they're all  painted perfectly with white glitter  nail polish and one of my toes has no  nail polish on it why don't we take a  wild [ __ ] guess which toe it was like  guess like is anybody guessing it was  the four toe ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  and so yeah and then we are driving to  our friend's house me and my best friend  my close friend right now and we're  driving to his house and I'm like yo I  want McDonald's like McDonald's sounds  so dink  I'm just getting put McDonald's I'm so  good I want a hot and spicy so we get  McDonald's and our McDonald's total was  five dollars and ninety two cents and  then I get a message on my tumblr that  said  dollars and ninety two cents and  I was just like I was wrong now I'm  gonna [ __ ] kill myself like I'm so  done with this [ __ ] this is ridiculous  so at this point I realized that either  the car we're driving in because I'm  always in that car or my phone is like  tapped because my best friend is  obviously not [ __ ] with me because I  had his phone and like no one else was  with us like this isn't like one of my  friends [ __ ] with us so I yell out  loud and I'm like hey stalker like  you're so funny tapping my car or my  phone like I'm thinking of a number  between one and five hundred what is it  and I get a message and the message is  like  and I was like oh you know yeah  so sketch so [ __ ] yet so then  everything like kind of chills out and  my stalker stops messaging me all the  time like he chills because I'm freaking  out I filed a police report and I'll get  more into that as this video goes on I  know so I file a police report the next  day and my stalker chills out and then  one day I'm driving in the car and my  friend left a comment on my YouTube  channel like pretending to be my stalker  and I was freaking out and then he was  like no it's a joke like it's  just joking it was me and I was like  okay like you're so funny like haha like  thanks for [ __ ] with me and then my  stalker messages me funny like lol like  no one can be me haha yeah weird right  weird so weird so I filed the police  report and then the police get involved  and it was my stalker from second grade  are you in shock because me too I was so  shocked so my stalker from second grade  got caught and arrested for harassment  and like tapping a phone and like all  this like all this stuff and I come to  find out after he gets arrested that it  wasn't just my phone that was tapped it  was like a bunch of other peoples and he  was also stalking like ten other girls  like just like me like all this stuff he  had like a shrine to me like every  picture that was on my phone he had like  all my texts he was like getting like  apparently what he did is called like  cloning a phone and that means like my  phone was on his phone like his phone  was like my phone like every time I go  to text he would get the same text like  his home screen was my home screen he  had every app I have like you know what  I mean like my phone was also on someone  else's phone and so he got arrested and  he is now in jail haha so I got my  stalker arrested I know I'm a great  person I didn't ever want it to get to  that and I was totally fine with the  occasional social media stop but when  you're following my every [ __ ] move  like that's how I heard a noise I got  scared of I have my tumblr and stuff  like bugged to where it's like not  bugged but like if somebody leaves you a  message that's creepy I can like trace  their IP address and
