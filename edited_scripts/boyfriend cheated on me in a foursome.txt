my hat says [ __ ] feelings but I actually  have a lot of feelings I'm just trying  to be trendy and I'm also wearing a  onesie his pants that I was gonna try to  cover that up but it just I'm a mess  hi guys it's Tana mojo I hope you were  having a really awesome day today so  today's video is going to be a story  time video if you will kind of story  time kind of not about some crazy dreams  that I've had and a really quick like  fun fact about me is that I have always  had incredibly vivid dreams my entire  life and when I say vivid I mean like so  vivid like so vivid and you know when  most people wake up from their dreams  they like can't remember them I don't  have that problem at all every dream  I've like ever happened like I remember  it as vividly as when I was dreaming it  also in my dreams my dreams always only  involve me and like the same eight or  nine people like there's never really  random people in my dreams sometimes  they'll be celebrities or they'll be  like extras if you will like random  people in the background of my dreams  but like the main characters of my  dreams are always the same people it  will either be like my mom and my dad or  like my best friends are like my  boyfriend or just like basically that  that's it like my close friends and my  family and my boyfriend like there's  never really any other people in my  dreams and every single night I have  four to five vivid vivid dreams I can  wake up and literally tell you every  single one and every single thing that  happens in them and it's been that way  my entire life I have no idea why but  yeah it's super weird also if I like  wake up in the middle of the night  during a dream like no matter what when  I go back to sleep that dream will like  resume it's not that I like lucid dream  or that I can control my dreams because  I can't do either one and have no desire  to do either one it's just that my  dreams themselves are very vivid and  and I wake up I mean even if I like wait   minutes if I go back to sleep the  dream will continue I don't know it's  really really really weird but yeah so I  often have the most weirdest dreams when  they involve my boyfriend and I had some  really weird dreams in the last like  three or four months that involved him  and the other day he gave me the idea to  tell these dreams on camera and I was  like damn that's a really really good  idea like thank you for this idea but  yeah he gave me this idea to tell them  on camera and I thought that it was just  a really really good idea because they  are crazy  so yeah today's video is a storytime but  not a storytime involving some weird  dreams that involve my boyfriend and  yeah so dream number one is the  inspiration for this video and by far  the like strangest of the three if you  will and I never really understood girls  when they would get mad at their like  boyfriends for something that they did  in a dream because I'm like it's a dream  you can't get mad at someone for  something they did in a dream like  that's crazy  and then I have this dream and I  literally woke up and called him and I  was like okay like I get it whatever  like this happened in a dream but the  [ __ ] dream verse knew he was a piece  of [ __ ] and was like literally in a  pissy mood for like  minutes like I'm  not even getting you I was literally in  a pissy mood because of this dream so  the dream started off in a house party  and this house party had all of my best  friends like around me like there and  the person throwing the house party was  someone that I don't really like it was  actually the guy that I talked about in  my one of my q and A's with my heart  attack date story it was that guy that  was hosting the party and so me and my  boyfriend went to the party and like my  best friend's or with us as food him at  all yeah so wrong with the party and  there are these three girls at this  party and these three girls are three  girls that I don't really like and I  don't dislike a lot of people so this is  weird that all these people I dislike or  like in this dream I  like have problems with a lot of people  at all but yeah there were these three  girls that I didn't like and one of the  girls I did not like because she is like  a homewrecker how if you will  she's very catfished she annoys me no  talking [ __ ] nothing like that just not  my cup of tea the other two girls are  the definition of like party drug head  like I do I'm not going anywhere in life  I use everyone like those kind of girls  don't like any of those three girls my  friend group isn't close with them like  they're just not my cup of tea like they  steal from people  sketchy don't like that they were in the  stream and so in this dream they're  right like the party was in this house  and there was a big fire outside and  nobody knew about the fire but me for  some reason and it was a bunch of RVs  catching on fire in my dream so I went  outside with the owner of the party like  the owner of the house the guy that I  don't like and we put out all the fires  and I come back inside and I go upstairs  in the house and my boyfriend is having  a foursome like a threesome know him in  the three girls a foursome with these  three girls in my dream like he's like  [ __ ] all four this is so insane oh my  but yeah we weren't dating at the time  when I have this dream or we weren't  like dating my dream I had they're like  we were just like talking if you little  but still whatever anyways that doesn't  really matter I'm just stating that I  feel like I'm settling a story with my  boyfriend cheated on me but he didn't  it's a dream do you see like that's how  vivid it was anyways so yeah I walk in  on my boyfriend like for summing these  three girls that I hate and I'm like  trying to break it up and in real life I  would not try to break it up I would  just be like peace the [ __ ] out you're a  ho euro euro ho I'm breaking up with you  bye and I would leave but in this dream  I was literally trying to like pry these  girls off of my boyfriend it was so  [ __ ] weird and he like wasn't and  that's why I was like so mad like in my  dream I was like fighting with them to  get off him and he like didn't want them  to get off him that's why I was like so  mad when I called him I was like you  [ __ ] hung like you're a hoe but  anyways yeah it was a dream and then so  I leave the house and the  fires still going on outside and I'm  trying to call him to be like hey like  there's a fire which in real life I  would be like burn in hell like [ __ ] you  but um yeah I was trying to tell him  there's a fire and then he's like oh I'm  at my house now and so I like drive to  his house did I Drive I can't remember I  walked or drove I don't know so yeah  dream me walk through the house I show  up and I'm like do you have a [ __ ]  explanation for this like are you  kidding me like I can't believe you  would do that and he's like I don't want  to talk about it I'm playing a video  game that made me dream me even more mad  and then I walked outside of his house  and like every X I've ever had and like  old friends were like is there to  consult me and it was like the weirdest  dream in my whole life and I woke up and  I called him and I was like [ __ ] you  yeah it was that was a weird dream dream  number two I briefly talked about in a  QA but me and my boyfriend weren't  dating yet so I kind of like didn't tell  the whole story of the dream because I  didn't know what to refer to us as if  that makes sense like I didn't want to  like create a bunch of questions from it  but now that we are official when I can  talk about whatever the hell I want to  hi I'm gonna tell you the story of a  really weird dream so over the summer  before I started dating him we lived in  this apartment this isn't like a dream  I'm giving you some backstory we lived  in this apartment because we have a  long-distance relationship he goes to  college in Reno but over summer he comes  home to Vegas because that's where he's  from so we lived in this like  month-to-month apartment basically for  those three months and in that apartment  it was him and his best friend they like  owned it and we would just have our  friends over all the time it was a  really really good time it was really  fun so in this dream I was in the  apartment right and I was like alone at  first completely alone and I went in our  room and I went to sleep in the dream  just practicing again in the dream so I  went to sleep and in my dream I wake up  like not in realize in the dream  dreaming wakes up to this guy that is  our close friend like just a friend I  wake up to this guy laying on me and  like whispering in my ear like trying to  hook up with me like trying to like get  with me and it was like really real but  he was like  dream it was like trying to have sex  with me you know I don't know why all of  you dreams like sex related I swear I'm  not like a kinky sex fiend I have normal  dreams too I don't know but yeah this  guy was like trying to [ __ ] me in the  bed of the guy that I'm talking to you  and I'm just like no absolutely not like  get off of me whatever and then my  boyfriend comes in the room to see it  and he's like what the [ __ ] is going on  because like I was like all over me and  I was like half asleep and I was like  saying no and my boyfriend gets on top  of me like I'm wearing a onesie of pants  but I'm just gonna show you like he gets  on top of me like over me like this like  over my body sorry for my outfit of the  day it's really great hashtag youtuber  hacks but yeah he like gets on top of me  like that and then he starts projectile  vomiting onto me but it's not like  regular vomit it's like green and it was  like the prettiest turquoise green ever  I know that's really weird that I like  remember that so I'm trying to find  something turquoise on my floor but I  can't my arms not clean either another  youtuber hack but yeah so he sets  projectile vomiting into my mouth and  it's like not getting on my face it's  not going everywhere it's like a direct  hose stream of vomit in my mouth and  it's green and I have this hair toner  that smells just like a green apple and  the vomit tasted just the way my hair  toner smell that's literally how vivid  my dreams are like taste smell touch  color like everything I remember so well  so then you vomits like into my mouth  for like  minutes it was like a stream  it was weird and then he gets up and  leaves the like apartment because he's  like mad and then I go out into the room  and all of a sudden all of our best  friends are like there and they're like  couples like it's all of our friends  that are other couples like there's not  like just one person it's like all of  our friends that are couples too and  they're all standing there like I can't  believe you cheated on him I can't  believe you got with someone else Ted I  can't believe you and then I was trying  to like explain it to them and like  couldn't like might like it wasn't like  working and then so I go like chase  after him and he's just vomiting like  projectile everywhere outside and I like  couldn't like I literally couldn't like  like it wasn't working and then I woke  up in the apartment  I have this room in the apartment he was  like there and everything was like fine  and it was so weird and so the last  dream I had was probably like a month  ago I remember I had it the day of I  heart radio Vegas so whenever that is I  don't know like a month or two my month  or two ago  I don't know so then I had this dream  that me and my boyfriend were going on  this adventure to like go somewhere and  we were like ready to go on this  adventure and then we but we were in  Longview Texas and if you know where  Longview Texas is that's pretty far from  here and that's where my grandma's  that's where my grandma is from so  that's why we're there and we were  staying at my grandma's house together  before we went on this adventure and so  we were staying in the house and while  we were there I got a knock on the door  and the door was like big and glass and  it's not like that at my grandma's house  so that was weird  like everything looked like my grandma's  house but the door and so there was a  knock at the door and I go to get the  door and it's one of my like pretty good  friends and he's got like long hair he's  like the surfer hippy type normally but  in this dream he was like had his hair  slicked back like into like a bun he was  wearing like a suit and tie which is  nothing like him at all like he wouldn't  wear that ever like do that ever he's  very like hippie like dreads like surf  snowboard like live with the earth  brother like live with the plants man  you know he's one of those so and I'm  not insulting him he's my friend but  anyways so he rings the doorbell and he  hands me like a briefcase basically  saying like the adventures that will  like follow you today are going to be  the weirdest of your life you will have  to save the life of like a loved one or  something and I'm like why are you  giving me this and he grabs my face and  kisses my forehead and then like leaves  into the distance and just leaves me  with this briefcase and then my  boyfriend comes out and is like why did  he kiss you on the forehead look what's  this like that means my boyfriends are  like a dick okay no I got but it's dream  him anyways what am I saying that I'm so  confused in this video if you can't tell  so yeah um I'm like I don't know like  read this and then the day goes on and  so there's this really crazy girl that  is a  friends of a lot of people that I'm  friends with I don't really like her  she's very crazy I'm not gonna say who  it is but yeah I don't know why my  dreams really involve people that I  don't like a lot but yeah so there's  this really crazy girl that I'm not a  big fan of in life and in my dream  so I'd lay down for a nap and I wake up  and my boyfriend's gone and there's a  letter that like she is with my  boyfriend like that she's kidnapped him  like left for me to find basically so  then I go on this journey and I'm with  this old couple it's like a random old  couple like not old but they're like   like  and they help me hike this  mountain then it's like made up of these  small stones and the stones all have  brandy melville stickers on them I don't  know why but yeah so I hiked this  mountain when I get to the top of this  mountain there's a flag and on the flag  it's like a United States flag and on  the flag there's a post-it note from the  girl it was a pink post-it note  literally my dreams are so vivid and I  read it and she's like your boyfriend is  here like you have like like four  minutes and something to save him and it  took me like hours in this dream to hike  this mountain so that I have to get down  this hour hike mountain in like four  minutes so I'm like running hopping the  stones like falling and I get to the  bottom and my boyfriend is like tied to  this tree he's like handcuffed to this  tree and there's only he's like big men  in suits with like big guns like  protecting him like not letting me get  to them like they're gonna shoot me if I  try to get to it hey man apparently  those guys were hired like by the crazy  girl so that I one by one in the stream  take their guns and I'm like banging  them in the head with it like I'm not  killing them but I'm like knocking them  out and finally I get to him and I like  untie all of the rope and he's like  [ __ ] up his eyes are like big and his  face is like melting and then so I'm  like trying to like I'm like saving his  life basically getting him back to  consciousness and so I start carrying  his body back to my grandma's house in  Texas and then I find this big like  Christmas box and I open it and it's a  letter from the crazy girl saying that  she gave him like  hits of like acid  like LSD and that it was gonna like kill  him if I did  survive him and then all of a sudden all  these ambulances like showed up to save  the day and they like saved his life and  arrested the girl who was hiding under  the tree then he was like rope too and  then I woke up and I called him and I  was like hey did you do any acid and I  hope not I think did you did you see  this girl yeah I don't know I really  don't know so those were three of some  really crazy vivid dreams I've had in  the last couple months and I have a lot  of dreams so if you like to hear about  crazy dreams
