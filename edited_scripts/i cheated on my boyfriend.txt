haven't watched my last video please go watch it um it's the  time i was a horrible friend part one and two where essentially i basically like hooked  kissed and then dated my best friend's boyfriend doesn't paint me in the best light i'm  like highly aware of that like we didn't date after they broke up but still i was a cassie i was literally a cassie if  you're from euphoria then you know um but i was talking about in that video  about how like just normalizing how people make mistakes and [ __ ] and like i was basically saying like you know i'm  always somebody that would give somebody a second chance because i am no saint i am no virgin mary mother teresa um i  have cheated before i have definitely like hurt other people before not intentionally obviously i've never  intentionally hurt somebody but it's happened like in life nobody is immune or prone to mistakes you're gonna make  mistakes mistakes are how you learn and how you grow sickly this is going to be the one time  one and only that i cheated and this is actually going to piggyback off of a story that i already have on my channel  called my crazy ex who tried to kidnap me now his name is damian that's what we call  him um and no hate to him he's changed a lot as a person he's actually a pretty good  person now we do still keep in contact okay um so no hate towards him this is just like a funny story that he's a part  of and we were actually talking about it the other day because we're you know we're cool like i said uh you know we've moved past the the just the drama and  the the bad stuff you know people

working with me now let's get on to the story time we're going to take it back  i'm going to stop saying the years that my story times took place because number one it doesn't matter and number two it  gives people more of an opportunity to find out who this is possibly about and i just don't have time for it i don't  care i really don't so we're gonna take it back years ago  you some years ago um i will say how old i was i believe that i was i was about to turn . i  just turned . [ __ ] gross so four years ago okay i basically listed the date you know what [ __ ] it um it was  four years ago and i'm gonna kind of piggyback off the story of my crazy ex who tried to kidnap  me so if you guys are new here it's basically an x that i had that  the relationship was just super toxic up and down tumultuous he was a little bit of a loony uh was not is now but was and  um which is a little crazy right a little possessive if you will so basically me  and him were going through it and i ended up  breaking up with him and this was a round i want to say like september october that michael  myers movie had just come out halloween and he wanted to go see it and we had already been broken up but we were  talking about how we were going to basically work on things together and fix stuff and  you know get back into a healthy state of a relationship our relationship was just like basically doing from the start  let's just let's just say that he was like hey let's go see this michael myers movie just came out you know we can go on a  little movie dave we can get food it'll be great if you guys watch the story time you already know how that  night went where i was almost kidnapped so after i was almost kidnapped um  i pretty much was good off of damien i was like you know what this is just not the type of  relationship i want to be in like i'm always attracting these toxic guys i don't understand it  and next time i'm definitely going to [ __ ] do my eyebrows off camera what is this [ __ ]  and i was like i'm just ready to let go and be single and like every time that me and damian had broken up we had  always just like came back to each other and it was just super toxic it's like we  didn't want to be with each other but we didn't want to be without each one though we wanted to with each other but it just never worked um  it was like how many red flags can be present in a relationship when you just realize that it's just not  gonna [ __ ] work anymore so basically i had decided to be steer clear from him  and he was kind of you know still calling me still trying to talk to me trying to work things out and  i was just done like you know when you reach that boiling point where you're just point blank period chapters closed  stories over case dismiss like that's literally how i felt i was just like i'm good like i'm all set and the thing with me and maybe it's because i'm a pisces  maybe it's because i'm a libra moon maybe it's because i'm stupid but um no i'm just kidding i'm not stupid don't  talk about yourself that way because your body doesn't know when you're joking so i don't know what it was but  i had an issue back then and still present day where i have a hard time letting things go even though i know  they're not good for me especially when somebody can make me laugh so the thing about damien is that he was and still is  one of the funniest people i have ever [ __ ] met in my entire life and like when things were good they were good  when things were bad oh my god like just call like just literally put us in the middle of a [ __ ] train like just put  us in the middle of a train track that's a train wreck titanic round two by the way  does anybody have a [ __ ] obsession with the titanic like i really feel like  i was on it in the past life hopefully i wasn't but like i'm i'm so  obsessed with the titanic i don't know what it is but i've always been since i was a little girl and recently i've been seeing a crap ton of like tick tocks  talking about like theories of the titanic or what the last moments would have looked like or like special facts  on tick tock and i already said that um and i'm just i'm my obsession is opening so my one goal before the year ends is  to go to tennessee and visit the museum that would be so cool i had a problem with letting people  go even though they were like absolutely horrible for me like i would see red flags i would try to paint them blue or  like i would see things and i'd be like oh well maybe it's because of this like i always have to have an answer to everything and justify everything and  sometimes like a person that's not meant to be in your life is just not to be meant to be in your life not saying that like  damien's a crappy person but sometimes a crappy person is just a crappy person they don't always have to be narcissistic they don't always have to  have sociopathic tendencies or narcissistic tendencies you don't have to like diagnose them like sometimes  people are just bad people you know what i mean so um basically i just feel like we just  weren't meant to be and i was good and the thing about me like i was trying to say is that i have a hard time letting people go but once i let you go like i  let you go and that's it and once my feelings are detached it takes a long time but like there's no coming back so  basically i had let this relationship go and i was just starting to focus on me i believe at this time i was considering  going back to school for psychology because that's what i originally went to and then um you know  i i left took a break for like my mental health and i was going to go back though i'd  always plan to go back and i was thinking about going back at this time and i was just thinking about like things that i can do to like improve my  life you know what i mean i just want to like a fresh start i just wanted peace like i just grew up around so much chaos  that now all i crave is peace and that's why you guys are always like oh my god dakota like your life is crazy and i'm  like no it was crazy it was chaotic and it's either like you grew up in chaos and either you still crave chaos and  that projects into your adult life and your relationships and friendships and you know those people i just like love  drama it's like yeah you definitely grew up in chaos and you're one of those people that loves chaos i'm not like that i grew up in a chaotic environment  and now i crave peace like i don't want anything to do with anything chaotic leave me alone pick somebody else  somebody else pick somebody else i don't i'm not i'm not addressing this crowd right now please pick somebody else  where's this one night where my friend lauren which is her real name i don't think it  [ __ ] matters um but we're not friends anymore so it doesn't matter but this girl lauren that  i was cool with at the time my homegirl was like hey what are you doing tonight it was fall and i just i love fall so  much like fall is my favorite season i'm outside all fall like i'm just obsessed  with fall so it was a fall night and it was just really like nice outside it was that  perfect like cardigan weather where you don't have to wear a jacket but you still have to wear like boots and jeans  and stuff and so she's like what are you doing do you want to go to the um the  festival in nagatok which is where my mother lives which is where i i used to live and um  i was like oh yeah that's perfect we could go like i can go visit my mom say what's up and then come meet you guys  where you're at and it'll be fun and so every year they have this like festival in the town where it's kind of just like  an end of summer going into fall festival there's vendors there there's food there's like bracelets that you can  buy or make there's like little um what's it called what are those things called tapestries  that you can buy it's a vibe it's cool so i was like yeah like let's go to it that sounds like a lot of fun i'll see  if anybody else wants to go and my other friend was also going to be there too  and we're just going to call him sam so my friend sam was going to be there sam's a guy by the way um  and i was texting him and i was like hey i heard you're going to be at the naugatuck festival would you want to  meet up with me and lauren he was like oh yeah i'll actually be there in a little bit we can meet over here at this  time i'll see you then so we had our plans you know i get ready i did my makeup i think i have a picture from the  night too that i'll insert in here and we head out to the naga talk festival  now like i said your girl was single single dakota in relationship dakota  not very different but in a way a little bit like when i'm in a relationship i'm so good off guys like i'll be you know  all night i'll be nice i'll say hi but like i will not be afraid to turn somebody down like if i am in love with you and  you are my man which i hope i would be in love with you if i was with you um i will not even  like look another guy's way like when i'm in love [ __ ] like the guy that i'm with is the only guy i see which is why i  believe that you can't love two people at the same time you can have love for somebody and then love somebody at the  same time and also loving and being in love are like literally two completely different things so i really do feel  like when people are like oh yeah you can love so you can love two people at once no you can't because if you truly love  the first you wouldn't even want the second you know what i'm saying basically we had gone to this festival and there  was this bar called  which i have oh my goodness so many stories about   and [ __ ] nagatak when i was living in my apartment um that my mother is currently living in  now she was moving back from florida and then i gave it to her and then i moved back to my home my hometown but um  i was in that apartment and my mom had come and she was like getting a divorce from her husband and i was like why  don't you just come live with me and get back on your feet and then you know when the lease is up you can stay and i'll go  and she was like great so that meant that i had like a babysitter if i wanted to go do stuff and i remember my mom was  like dakota you never do anything all i ever see you do is like sit home like go please go do something like you're young  like you're supposed to be out doing things with your friends and for so long i had lost my my identity in motherhood  which is why i feel like i'm so like i'm such an advocate for like not losing  your identity when you become a mom like if you want to go have a girls night go have a girls night like it's okay it's  okay to go out and not miss your kids like it really is like i'm with aubry so much that if i go out with my friends for one  girls night i am not that mom that's [ __ ] face timing her and being like oh my pookie i miss you i'll see when  they come no i'm like you're good you're with your grandparents i'm gonna go out and have me a brunch  like and i'll be back in six hours like i just like we need to normalize like having free time for moms i love my  daughter but i'm with her every single day when i'm having one day to myself  she's good with her grand grandpa or grandma so anyway sorry i had to take a little eating break because i just realized that besides my protein shake  i really eat today a lot of you keep asking me to go to can you do mukbangs  i would love to but the minute i get a comment being like oh my god i  can't stand the way she chew i will literally fight somebody that i will come for someone's life like  why watch a mukbang if you don't like the sound of chewing are you okay i didn't think so i put my daughter to  bed and texted lauren texted sam  and was like hey i'm on my way i'll meet you guys here i think with sam unfortunately we're not  like i wouldn't say we're not friends anymore i just can't i can't associate myself with him  anymore because it's the morality of things and  he's really good friends with my daughter's father and never in my life am i gonna be that  person that's like oh my god if you are remotely affiliated with my daughter's father you  know i can't have anything to do no but the the morality part of me is how do  you find it within you to support befriend  be friends with um hang out with go out with somebody who doesn't do [ __ ]  for their child like that's so lame to me like because you know sam is good friends with me  and then he's really good friends with my daughter's father and he was friends with my daughter's father before me but one thing is that my daughter's father  treats sam like crap because he treats everybody like crap and doesn't care about anybody but himself  and um clearly and you know he and i wish him all the  best it's not to talk bad about him but i'm just i'm calling a spade a spade like  he just doesn't care about anybody he treats people like crap and i feel like sam doesn't see that and with sam he  wants to hold on to that friendship it's like if you see me a single mom and i'm like trying to you know make it out here and  whatever and you you know you follow me on social media you see my struggles and what i go through but then like you're hanging out with my daughter's father  yes the the friendship was before mine and yours but it's like you know he doesn't do anything for her  you know that he is not active like how are you friends  with him like that's why i don't understand and it's crazy because like my daughter's father tries to tell people like oh like she hasn't let me  see my kid and blah blah blah and like you know she keeps her away from me where  because it was her birthday last week did you text me you have my number i've had the same number since literally i  was  years old i'm now . you know my number how am i keeping her away from you like  are you okay okay um anyway so just don't get how you can be friends with me and call me a  friend but like you know the things he says about me you know what he does and you're still cool with him that's what i don't get so me and sam uh  fortunately i had to disassociate myself from him and he's a great person and i love him and he was  my really good he was like one of my best friends at one point okay um me him my friend tori and then my other  guy friend used to like just wreak havoc all over town and go out together and have a great time but i had to put that  aside because it's like like i said it's the morality and also i don't if her if my daughter's father  is not going to be in her life i don't want him knowing  like what she's doing what she looks like her milestones her achievements because it's like you should be here  you know what i'm saying like you should be here seeing her accomplish all those things  seeing all the great things she's doing you know like seeing her achieve milestones on her report card  seeing her get her gymnastics medal like you're not here for any of that and  that's by choice by you because i've i've never i've never  said you can't see her i've never you know like you made it that way  so why should you get to be a part of her life via social media  and see pictures of her and see you know everything she's doing and getting an update when you're not here  you know so unfortunately i had to kind of disassociate myself from anybody  who had anything to do with him like even like one of my really good guy friends who was friends with both of us like he  stopped chilling with him because he was like how do you not have anything to do with your daughter like that's so lame i don't  understand that so i'm not saying people have to pick signs but it's the morality right like it's  it's the moral of it i could never ever be friends with a girl who doesn't have anything to do with her kids it's one  thing if like they're in a custody batter or the dad is narcissistic or be like i get that that i'm not talking about i'm talking  about like you're just you're capable of having your kids you just don't want your kids and so you want to just go out and go on camping trips and go on  vacations and go drinking and like no like i that like that's a deadbeat then that goes for mothers and fathers  and i could never be friends with somebody like that because that's disgusting like be in your kid's life don't have kids  and don't contribute to having kids if you're not gonna be in their life there's no excuse  point blank period the end chapter's closer you've gotten case dismissed [ __ ] nothing there's no excuse  basically met up with lauren and sam and we met up like right in front of   and there was like a little fire going on they had these like big fires and these big tins and they just keep like  throwing more wood into it and more like just flames come out and it keeps you so warm and there's all these little like  vendors and like little girls running around making braces with their sisters and like people selling scarves and  like chocolate and there's like a pizza truck and there's such good food there's like these amazing freaking churros you  can get like a churro on crack basically by the way i'm using high killer lashes in style round trip you guys always ask  me what lashes i'm wearing the direct link is in my bio under where it says faq which stands for frequently asked  questions so i go up to him and i'm like hey sam how have you been i give him a hug we start  talking and just chit-chatting and i i hadn't seen him in like a long time me and sam would go like  like like periods of time without seeing each other just because life is busy you know we're not young kids anymore i met  sam when i was  um going on a night team and you know we weren't little kids anymore we were  adults with their own lives at our own jobs just talking shooting the [ __ ] and then lauren knows sam pretty well too  they actually knew each other before i even knew either of them so they start talking and conversing and i look next  to sam he's with a group of like two to three guys and i'm like oh like hi who are you like what's your name and they  all introduce themselves to me and they're some of his friends and they're just super cool guys like super  high vibrational like just energetically amazing like really just like nice guys  up these are my friends he starts introducing them other guys don't matter the one that matters in this uh story is  my ex which um i was talking about a little bit briefly of my ex tried to kidnap me damien um  that's my ex but i also mentioned the ex in it that i the one that i cheated on with damien so  i didn't really talk about that i just said how i like i had gotten into a relationship i briefly talked about how  um after me and jamie broke up i had briefly gotten into a relationship and it only lasted for a little bit it  wasn't that long at all um and then me and him ended up breaking up i was honest with him and told my  cell phones for damian went back to damien x y and z you really have to go watch that story i'll link it here and in the bio as well so  um i believe in that story i just called him my ex because we didn't talk about him too much so we're going to give him the name of where doesn't give the name  of bobby sam introduces me to bobby and he's like oh it's my friend bobby you know we hang out together we go hiking  we do this and that um and he was like you know he's really cool like you should  get to know him so i go up to him and i say hi and like i don't know where we kind of just like click he had like um a  sister who was a single mom so we kind of bond over that and we both liked the  same thing we both liked crystals and meditation and like journaling and hiking and stuff and he was very much like a nomad like he definitely i would  describe him as that person that like walks through the woods and like doesn't wear shoes and like grounds themselves and you know wears  like crystal necklaces and stuff but it was kind of cool it was my first time like interacting with a guy like that because i had been on my spiritual  journey at this point for two years so it was far and few in  between that i found people that were also on their spiritual journey and my friend sam was like a little bit but not  as much as i was um and it was just cool it was very cool to meet somebody that was a guy that was  into the same stuff as i was so we kind of start talking and we're talking for  quite a bit of time and eventually everyone's kind of like hey let's go over to this like cute little dive bar  we can shoot pool hang out you know get some drinks and just continue the night so the festival is  kind of like wrapping up so we all walk over and we try to get into this bar but all the boys are wearing sweatpants so  um in certain places actually no i'm sorry we tried to go to  and they wouldn't let us in because the boys are  wearing sweatpants there's like  you are not a high scale high class bar like you literally like a  bouncer there one time literally told me off because i tried to go out the back door and i didn't know it was an emergency exit i didn't even touch it i  was just looking at it he screamed at me literally screamed at me and then my friend saw him at a different bar and  she sent me a picture and was like this was the guy that told you off i think he literally i've never had a grown man in  my whole entire life scream at me the way that this [ __ ] bouncer did and i'm just like  like what is going on like i literally hope like that bouncer every time he goes to the dmv longest line ever every  time he goes to the beach hope a bird shits right on your bald head like i hope every single time  that you go to find your remote for your tv it's not there you have to order a new one like i just  i'm not a petty person maybe i am i'm not the drama am i the drama am i  the drama i don't think i'm a drama maybe i am probably like an aries or  something right like probably has like super just aries in his chair anyway bobby lived really close to where we were so  him and sam went and changed their clothes so we  could like get in places okay so this is where the [ __ ] kicker comes  i had spoken to damien probably in weeks right for two weeks he actually like solidly kind of like left me alone  i think he got the hint that i just wasn't coming back and that i was done and i was ready to move on  when i tell you we used to go to this bar all the time all the [ __ ] time all the time it was like my spot like  you know you have like a home bar that you go to that was  church for me so they go and  i'm like oh you know what let's just go in and like have a drink or something and we'll wait for them you know we're  all of age so we can just wait and chill and when they come back they come back  so tell me how i walk into this bar and the first person i see is damien  even me and damian dated like we didn't go out like that we kind of were like home bodies we would go out to eat or we  go to like new york and stuff like we'd go on like a ton excuse me of adventures but we would never like go to like local  bars and stuff like we were both kind of like over that scene like you know when you just get in a relationship and it's like  you're just kind of all about each other that was us so like the fact that he was even out was weird and of course he's  with like his brothers and his cousins and he's with um  hit one of his friends that i briefly talked to as well i used to be so messy back in the day i  don't think i'm a drama yeah i am and i'm just like god  why like why would you spring this on to my life like out of all days out of all days that i decide to come here  out of all days that i could have come here because i used to come here all the [ __ ] time why is my ex here  why so i literally walk in and i see him and i get uncomfortable and i'm just like yeah no because like we're not on  good terms and i was like i kind of want to leave and don't want to be here and they were like you know what yeah um  let's actually just wait for them to get back and then we'll go ahead and go to another bar so these poor guys walked  all the way to sam's house to change out of their freaking sweatpants to get into this bar and we are now  leaving and not even going into it so they get back and they're like okay guys you know let's go get like a beer and we're like yeah i know we're not gonna  stay here and they're like what the hell so we end up leaving and i'm getting texts from  you know damian my ex-boyfriend and he's just like you know just basically like just saying like stupid stuff like oh  like who was that that you were with is that your name like all this like dumb dumb stuff and i'm just like yeah no bye  so i put my phone in my pocket and we decided to go to this like little hole in the wall bar that i had lived in  naugatuck for a bit but i had never seen before and um basically  it was just a cute little bar we go in there we start shooting pool and we start going over to the bar to just get  like some beers and stuff and me and sam are just talking we're talking about like you know meditation and like  mindfulness and all that good stuff and then again um bobby joins in on the conversation and he's contributing to it  and something about that was just very attractive i liked how he liked the things that i liked you know and  that we had some stuff in common but just because you have something in common with somebody doesn't mean you should be with them actually a lot of  times opposites not too opposite but to a certain level in degree opposites  really do attract sometimes and you need like diversity in a relationship or else  you're not going to grow like if you're both the same people how are you ever going to grow in the relationship you  get what i mean so we start talking and it gets to a point where like you know we basically  exchange social medias not numbers i don't really give people like my number when i first meet them more so like you  can have my instagram or whatever and so he gives me his instagram and i add him  and he adds me back and we're going we're playing pool and like you know the night is just kind of like winding down we have a couple of beers and we leave  and i didn't think anything of it um i actually at that point didn't really even think that me and sam would ever be  anything like we only had like one you know night like an interaction and i just i i didn't think of it that way i  was still getting over my relationship from damien so  i end up going home saying goodbye to my friends and i just continue on with life so halloween is getting a bit closer and  there was one day where bobby was carving pumpkins and  he'll put it on his instagram story and then me and my daughter were also  carving pumpkins and i put it on my instagram story too um and then i was like looking through  netflix i had like put on my story like oh does anybody you know have any good like netflix suggestions or shows to  watch and he had written back to me and i can't remember for the life of me what  he said but we start talking a bit about that and then  he starts talking a little bit about his you know niece and how they did pumpkins and uh he like posted a picture  of it and it was like kind of attractive because you know like i'm a girl mom and stuff so i feel like in general when girls see a guy with like a kid it's  just like so cute and adorable um yeah i definitely like was that person  at that time so i saw that and i was like oh that's cute because like whenever i'm thinking about talking to  somebody like i know it's crazy because i know that you don't know if you're going to  be with them forever or not but even if i think about going on a date with you like i want to know how you're going to be  as a dad in the future because family is so important to me so it's like a really important aspect so that was kind of  cute that i saw that not that i was even thinking about like us dating but it was just it was a bonus if the the  opportunity ever presented himself so we started talking about that we started  talking about how you know i'm a single mom and xyz and he's like oh yeah like i heard sam kind of talking a little bit  about your daughter's father and you know he doesn't sound like a real winner and i was like nope he's really not so  we started talking a little bit about that and then like i said we could relate because his sister was also a single mom and he was talking a little  bit about that and just like little things that we were able to relate on and find some common ground  so he says that he's going to go to sleep and i say i'm going to go to bed as well and the conversation wraps up  and it didn't really pick up too much until i want to see a few weeks later where he had checked in with me to see if i had ever watched that um  that netflix show and i said no and so we just started talking about that and then literally  the conversation like quickly segued into like we should hang out sometime like we seem like we have a lot in  common i was kind of looking for friends that i could vibe with and like do things other than just like drinking and  smoking all the time cover new things together and that was really like my main focal point at that point in my  life was like i wanted to get out of like the drinking and partying scene and really get into like  just doing things that were more fun like roller skating and movies and stuff like that remember he had said like oh  hey we should go on a hike together and the hike that he wanted to do was literally down the street from my  mom's house and i've been on the hike before but i didn't know the hike that i was about to get into okay like i  thought hiking was like for me maybe an hour on the trail these boys  sam bobby and those other two guys that were there with us at the little bar they hike all day [ __ ] like they'll  hike from  a.m to p like i couldn't no no like i have stallion in these don't  get me wrong but the way that my breathing is set up especially after having covered like i'm  all set and i told him what day i was free we made a date and then we went hiking and on the way  there he was like oh i told sam to come but i didn't tell him you're coming i'm gonna surprise him  and i'm just like what the f like i wanted to just be us like why can't we just hang out like i wanted to get to know you i already know  sam but like i look he like loved sam and i was happy he was coming but i was like at the same time like  really getting there and then sam pulls up and he comes up and like whenever sam would hug me he gave me like this big hug and he would like pick me up and  like swirl me around i miss him sometimes i really do he's a great person it's just like i said you know  association oh my god i didn't know you were going to be here we're finally going to get to go on our hike because me and sam been talking about hiking for  like literally years now keep in mind damien doesn't know that i'm going on this like hiking date  i don't even know if you can call it a date uh because i'm not really talking to him like like i said he would message me  once in a while uh once in a while i'd get like a blocked voicemail because if you didn't know if you go into your voicemail you  scroll all the way to the bottom it will say blocked voicemail and that's the voicemails that people who you have  blocked can leave for you because you can leave someone a voicemail even if you're blocked williams are going on  this hike and it lasted all day [ __ ] literally all day like we got there around three we  didn't go home till eight oh my goodness so we go on this first hike that's like beginner level i would  say there was like this beautiful waterfall beautiful scenery beautiful trees you know kind of like an incline  uphill but not too much to the point where you're like you know so then  we complete the hike at the end of the hike there's this beautiful view of  the i- highway so basically you go up this huge mountain and you stand at the  top and you look around and there's like just beautiful scenery you can see the whole highway and it's beautiful people  like rock climb up there and like spray paint their names and stuff like it's super cute so  i'm seeing this and i'm thinking oh my god this was so much fun like and me and um bobby are like talking on this hike  you know even though like all of his friends are there it was like me bobby sam and then two other guys and they  were like pretty cool and it's funny because like one of the guys there was helping me because i would go to get off of you know uh a  rock and like sometimes i would slip and so he would help me i could tell bobby was like getting jealous  um so i'm thinking like oh this was a great day we had a great hike you know maybe  we'll go get food now like a [ __ ] was hungry and then they're like okay guys time for the next spot and i'm like  what do you mean i thought this spot was complete like what are you talking about so apparently if you go to the bottom  there's like a whole other trail and i was not ready you guys like literally i remember to this day how badly i wanted  to be like i want to go home because like i was done like imagine doing a whole entire hike and then you're done  and then you [ __ ] gotta do a whole other hike after that i remember i was like wait guys give me a minute i need  to breathe because i don't know how these guys did it but they did not like [ __ ] breathe when they went hiking i guess they were so used to it and they  were like pros and i'm over here like oh i like to hike in my instagram bio yeah [ __ ] you can't even get up a mountain  like great gym teacher would be very unimpressed because i did win the ab challenge every single year when i did  the crunches push-ups every year so he would be very disappointed at me  so we get ready and we finish this hike and i'm just like absolutely exhausted we're actually  coming back down at this point it's like getting dark and i'm kind of getting a little nervous and i'm like um  i know you guys like oh my god dakota you're the only girl in a group full of guys um normally yeah i could totally  see how that would be scary lauren was supposed to come she didn't  she probably ditched me for one of her boyfriends the time which is why we are literally not friends anymore because  let me stop and uh that's literally neither here or there and  but me and sam had been friends for years and i trusted him enough to know that he wouldn't bring me around anybody that was like unsafe or anything you  know so we were fine but i was just kind of like oh my god like it's getting dark like let me go back to  the car and also it was freezing so i had to borrow bobby's jacket and  i was just like not prepared for this hike at all like i was like okay next time i'm bringing  so we end our mount everest freaking day and i ended up going back to bobby's car i say goodbye to sam  and we started driving and he was like i would ask you to go out to eat but we're kind of sweaty and i was like yeah i'm  like i'm ready to hit the hay anyway but like thank you so he drops me off at my mom's and he doesn't give me a hug  doesn't do really anything he just is like well i had a great time today thanks for coming we should hang out  again which i kind of found a little bit attractive i was like oh like he's not trying to like pursue me too heavy and i  can tell he likes me i could always tell okay i'm weird sometimes i could tell when a guy likes me and other times i'm like  super oblivious and i'm like huh and other times i just choose to be oblivious especially if it's a um  situation where i just want to be single and i don't want to be with anybody so i can tell he liked me but i was like  oh it's kind of attractive he didn't try to like pull a move or anything like i don't  know i find that kind of cool so he dropped me off and i went home and  then we started to text we started to exchange numbers then you know i feel like i kind of got a good like reading  on him and we exchanged numbers and we started to text for like that whole week so  as i was getting to know him a bit more you know after hiking through texting and stuff he was like do you want to go  out on a date with me and i was like yeah sure he's like okay i think you know maybe we should like go get dinner and go to the  movies and you know get to know each other a little bit more and i was like yeah absolutely so he comes to my mom's because like  like i said he lived like right near my mom so he comes to my mom's and i don't live with my mom but like i i  went over to her house because i was like oh he's like down the street i'll just come here so that way we can take the same car and it's easier and  i already known him for a couple months which is why i was comfortable with him picking me up don't ever let a guy pick you up on the first date i don't care  how good he looks how cute how many of your friends know him no drive yourself sis okay if you gotta  crawl out the window and say that your grandma's cat's dog is sick  you can at least leave with your own car what happened was i get to my mom's and he picks me up and we end up going out  to eat and we're just talking and the conversation's going pretty smooth it's not like forced or anything i was like a  little bit nervous but like not really um but the conversation's going pretty well we're just talking about like the  old days like high school and stuff and um you know where he went to school when i went to school i told him like i moved a million times i went to new jersey and  this or that and then we started talking about like how we knew sam was like you know he was our mutual friend and sam did not know that we were together by  the way um i didn't want to tell him because when i first met sam  sam loki had a crush on me and like i said we were uh friends with we both were friends with aubry's father and i  ended up like choosing like not choosing is like sam wasn't ever an option but like i ended  up um dating aubry's father and he always was like very like upset with me about it so  i felt bad i was like let me see where this goes first before i like you know sink my teeth into this and see you know  start like putting on social media and telling people what's up and afterwards we go and see a star is born by lady gaga um  it was a really good movie and it was honestly a really good date and during the movie you know like he didn't hold  my hand he didn't like there was no like physical interaction and then i i kind of was like thinking to myself like does  he like me like i don't understand like maybe he just is like super respectful like i don't know but my love language is physical touch so i can't know if i  like you if i don't at least like hold hands with you and feel your energy and absorb your aura sorry guys the lighting was like literally so horrendous i just  like i couldn't do it anymore i had to come up here and just get right um and now that i'm thinking  about it i could totally do makeup tutorials from like literally right here like this is my vanity  i just i always think like so far into like aesthetics and i'm like  but i don't like this because like it looks dark back there like it's just [ __ ] stupid like just do it and shut up anyway so he had left  the movies and we were driving home and just talking about how we should do this more often  and then we got into my house and again like he said goodbye like no hug like no kiss  like anything and by now i'm like this is like our second third time hanging out like i thought maybe he would like like make a move but i was like maybe he  dresses like a gentleman and like doesn't like to rush things honestly like to make a long story short things picked up  are we surprised really really quickly from there like super quick we started like dating and you know like i met some  of his family he didn't mean any of mine yet but i'm like some of his family and like i'd go over to his house and things like that so  what had happened was is we were developing a relationship and then damien found out so  damian ended up finding out and i don't remember how he found out because damian like doesn't have an instagram by the way like he doesn't have an instagram  he's like not a social like a social media person at all and he ended up finding out that i had a boyfriend which  is like weird actually no i do i think that he was using his brother's or his cousins or  somebody's page to look at my things and he ended up finding out that i had a boyfriend he was trying to figure out  who it was and things like that and like i said he had been like kind of leaving me alone for a little bit but then we  ended up well he ended up reaching out calling me and texting me and things like that like i would literally block  him and he would make like fake numbers to text me or he would call me on blocked and leave me a voicemail like  things like that are like he be parked outside of my house and his co-worker would text me and be like hey  i'm so-and-so's i'm damian's co-worker go outside and talk to him like things like that so he was like pursuing very  hard trying to like talk to me and get to the bottom of this and it got to the point where he like showed up in my house one day and was parked outside  and was not leaving until i came out like literally was like i will knock on the store right now  which is actually funny because the ex that i had um which was after damien um  did the same thing and he actually ended up knocking on my door my like literal father like answered the  door and was like who are you like so [ __ ] embarrassing like what the hell damien didn't do that my ex after him  did so i ended up having to go outside and like talk to him otherwise basically like he was gonna knock on my door and  it was gonna be his whole entire thing so i went to go outside and talk to him and he was just pressing me like who are  you talking to what's his name where he's from like he was trying to get all this information about bobby and i was  like not telling him anything i was like it's not your business we're not together anymore like you fumbled the bad with a bad [ __ ] period and now  you're salty because of it he was just going on like we probably sat there for like two hours literally two hours  talking about it okay and i just came to the i just i got to the conclusion i was like listen like  i'm sorry but there's like nothing else i can do like we are together now i'm not gonna leave him like he basically  was trying to like convince me to leave him and get back together with him and give him another chance and i was like no it's not happening  and i ended up leaving that conversation and he ended up driving off all angry and he was like he better hope i'm i  don't have a bad day otherwise i'm gonna [ __ ] him up like all of his stuff and i'm just like boy bye things progress  very badly they continue to get worse um what once was a a world where damian was calm cool and  collected and wasn't you know calling me and was kind of leaving me alone now that he knew  that i and a lot of guys do this yeah like they literally do this thing where like you'll break up right  and you don't talk but the minute they find out you're with somebody or the mid they find out you're doing good then  they want to reach back out to you it's like i'm not saying like damien did this because like he did want to be with me  when we were broken up but like so many of my exes i've done that like we'll break up and the minute they find out like i'm not accessible anymore they  want access to my energy and it's like now you want to show me why i should be with you like now you want to show me  why we should be together like what happened to that before so he was like constantly reaching out to  me calling me texting me like all this stuff i was on my way to my mother's house because i needed to drop off her  straightener and he knew that okay listen to how like joe from you this [ __ ] is okay like i  literally was like i dated a joe from you okay i was  on my way to my mother's house and he was like talking to me the whole car ride trying to convince me to you know  be with him and i kept just telling him no and i'm like yo like we can be cool we could be friends like maybe one day  we can you know be friends again but like right now it's just like not the time and i was trying to you know explain this to him  and he just wasn't taking no for an answer so i got to my mom's house and i dropped it off and i said okay well i have to go now and he was like um where  are you going just like stay on the phone me until you get there and i was like okay so i drove to bobby's house after and like i said bobby's house was  like a three minute drive not even from my mom's house it was like a couple of blocks over so i drive to bobby's and  then i tell him okay i really have to go i was like i'm where i need to be and he's like where are you at and i was like damian it's not your business like  you don't need to be worried about me like like kailani says uh what's the zombie  kayani where she's like [Music] of your um to know who i'm with  all about my [ __ ] like that song without them so i was like it's not your business click hung up the  phone tell me why i'm at bobby's house okay with my my my  new mans and we're just you know conversing watching some tv whatever and my phone's blowing  up like when i tell you blowing up it's blowing up back to back to back to back from damien and like i said i had  blocked him after that so he was calling me from any time i had ptsd up until a couple years ago every time i got a  blocked call because it was from him like and he just is like calling me calling  me calling me so a couple hours go by and i ended up having to leave because bobby has to go to work i have to go  pick up my daughter it was my day off from work that's why we were able to hang out i was working at a freaking crusty factory at the time it's a story  time for another time okay like so i'm leaving there and i get another call  like as i'm literally leaving right and so i pick up and he was like how was your boyfriend's house and i was like what  and let me remind you guys i never told damien that bobby lived near my mom so he's like dakota i  knew that you were there like the whole entire time and i'm like what are you talking about he's like i pulled up and i was like no you didn't like i really  am thinking that he's joking and he was like i pulled up to your new boyfriend's house like i pulled up to your new man's  house like his car is his color his house is this color i saw your car right there and he was like i was waiting for  you guys to come outside and you guys he wasn't joking because he described his house to a tee subscribe his house to a  team described his card to a t described like the gravel driveway to a t this man  figured out because he knew in the vicinity of where he lived drove around looked for my car which by the way was  in a secluded parking lot found my car and found his house and pulled up to his  driveway and was like straight up just posted waiting for us to come outside it's this freaking psychotic-ness for me  okay like i just don't understand so i'm like what is wrong with you i was like why would you even do that it's not like  it's not like i was with you right and then cheated on you with like this  person and then now like you're mad so you want to pull up like i get that but i'm like we were broken up for a bit  like a couple months actually and i'm gonna move like a month or so and it's like i'm in a new relationship now  because like you fumbled so like what like what is the reason i don't understand so i'm just like getting mad because i just feel like i can't live my  life like i can't live my life in peace and i'm just getting so conflicted and so annoyed so then one day i come home  and again you know like i blocked him i'm ignoring him i'm continuing my relationship with bobby and i come home in this like huge you guys  if there's one weakness that i have it's a few doordash me food  okay love that brownie points or if you get me red roses red roses and  sunflowers like literally the way to my freaking heart the gate but i'm getting these fixed tomorrow  don't come for me don't judge me judge your mother so um literally like that's the way to my heart i come home and like a dozen of  the most beautiful beautiful red roses are sitting on my front  doorstep with like baby's breath and like beautiful bouquet and this nice  like lace wrap oh my god you guys so beautiful and there's a card and there's  a stuffed animal and the card in it basically is just saying you know how sorry damien is and how much he loves me  and wants to be with me and that you know like even if i decide to  not choose him that you know he'll always love me and i'll oh i'll like he'll never forget me  basically it was like a it was like such a cute card like even this day it's so heartwarming it  literally was like when hannah montana or miley cyrus or whatever was trying to choose between  freaking uh jake and what's what was that guy's name what was her little boyfriend's name hold up jake  and jesse remember when hannah montana was trying to choose between jake and jessie like this was literally me so  then like i remember like i called my mom and i was crying and i was like he sent me roses and by the way ladies like  it's very sweet if a man sends you roses but there's a difference between sending roses because he loves you and he cares  about you he wants to show you his appreciation and there's a difference between setting roses because you [ __ ] up there's i [ __ ] up roses and there's  i love you roses okay and um trust me after this because yes we did end up getting back together spoiler  alert but um i did get you know like think like the thing with  um the thing with damian is he spoiled the crap out of me you guys spoiled the crap out of me like we went to new york went  to like the wax museum um he paid for our tickets he paid for the train right there he paid for our food he paid for  us to get these like wax moldings of our hands like holding together like this man probably more than anybody i've ever  been with to this day was so detailed in how he expressed his love for me because  my love language is a physical touch but it's also gifts and i'm not saying gifts as in like you have to get me like a  dior bag or a chanel bag but like gifts like picking up my favorite candy from the gas station or is that kind of like  acts of service not really um or coming home with roses like i love flowers i love flowers so [ __ ] much or like  just like you know like when you're listening to somebody talk about themselves and you take note on what they like and then you do that for them  and it's like surprising and it's like oh my god like he's actually listening to me that's how i felt when i was so  used to my whole entire life not being heard like don't get me wrong damien had great qualities he was the  first person that i ever told about what my family member did to me when i was younger um  the first person besides uh yeah no before i even told my mother he  was the first person that i ever opened up to it about i didn't open up about it completely but a lot of traumatic things  that happened to my life like i was able he was the first partner i had that i felt comfortable to open up to and he  helped me a lot through that and like he like when we were go we were good like he spoiled the crap out of me  like literally he got me like a  he took it back but he got me like a   vanity mirror um he was the one that always told me i should do youtube actually that's how we started talking  again recently is because he found my youtube and like wanted to congratulate me and he was always the one that was like yo  like you could really do this you can make a career out of this like you have the personality you have the drive you have like everything like you  should really put your all into this and like you know he always pushed me and he motivated me and when we were good we  were going we were bad we were [ __ ] horrible we were toxic and unfortunately at the time the toxic you know  tendencies outweighed the good times i just remember being so conflicted and i was sitting there and i was like okay on  one side i have bobby who's never done anything wrong to me has never you know said anything bad to me or called me  names or um you know try to kid at me or anything like that that i have you know but like i just felt like with bobby  like the connection wasn't there like it was there to a certain extent we liked a lot of the same things we were in a lot  of same things but like intellectually mentally just life what we were just so different and i felt like we couldn't  find a common ground outside of the things we had in common which is why i was trying to say that sometimes  opposites do attract you know and sometimes it's not just about like what you have in common sometimes you need more common ground than that and then i  have over here damien who yeah we've had some bad times together but he understands me he gets  me he knows what i like what i don't like he knows everything about me inside and out and like i just felt more of  like that connection to him but also i was with him for longer so that makes sense we were able to develop that  mental and physical and just connection i was really conflicted and i didn't know what to do and this couldn't have  come at a better time because i was just about to take a trip to vermont okay so i was about to take a trip to vermont  with my mother and my mother's best friend um because thanksgiving you know like i don't really have a big feel well  i do have a big family but i don't talk to majority of them because they're racist and homophobic but that's another story for another time um so i don't  really have a lot of family it's really just like my mom my dad aubrey like one of my cousins my grandpa and  that's basically it i really don't have any family wow that sounds very depressing well no  because i have you guys you guys are my family and i love you guys so [ __ ] much and i think that's why i get so emotional whenever i talk about  you guys or i talk about how many like subscribers like this is a thing like i don't do youtube because like  i don't do youtube like for the subscribers for the views for the sponsorships i literally one day just picked up my  camera and wanted to rant and i you guys liked it and then i kept doing it and i grew this like amazing family right and  i'm so grateful that now i get to do to it's always my biggest dream right like i'm living out one of my biggest dreams right now like i get to have an income  doing what i love every day i wake up excited getting to do what i love and i just i love you guys so much anytime i  get a message from you or an email from you like an ass decoder for you or a comment like i literally start tearing up because i'm like oh my god like what  i'm doing is changing people's lives you know because yes i'm a story time teller but i'm not one of those story time tellers where and i'm not saying there's  anything wrong with this but i don't come here just to like spill the tea like if i really wanted to if i was about views and i was about money and i  was about adsense and sponsorships and yes i get those things don't get me wrong but  if i was driven by the money i would be like up here in youtube land right now because i would title my videos so  deceiving i would like talk about things that i just there's certain stories i'll never tell because it's personal you  know um like there's certain things that i could do and there's like ways that i could go but with the way that my morality is set up i just don't want to  do that and my mission here isn't just to come out here and cheese me with you guys like you know yes i love to do that  like it's like we're all at a big slumber party or like a coffee date or like we're drinking our wine together cool but like i'm trying to teach you  guys a lesson within these stories and within my stories i make it relatable for somebody else so they don't feel  alone they don't feel like um misunderstood or if you haven't been through it you can learn from me like somebody literally wrote a comment and  they were like dakota i love your content so much but it literally teaches me like no offense but it teaches me on what i need to not do and i was like sis  this is why i do this like you know what i'm saying to either have somebody feel understood  right because suffering is like so alleviated when we know that we're not going through it alone or to  prevent somebody else from going through it yeah so anyway um basically i was very conflicted so i  end up um packing my bags and we're going to vermont and i you know said  goodbye to bobby and on the way there i had a long car ride to think and i realized on the car ride there  that i did not love bobby anything with me because i'm so  self-aware been told this by many therapists i know when i love somebody and it doesn't take a freaking year  doesn't take two years doesn't even take a couple of months like i know when i'm with somebody if i can picture  my life with them forever or if it's just temporary and i'm not a temporary type of gal i'm like truly an all or  nothing type of girl so i knew right away that this just was not i knew i didn't love him but i also have  a thing and i'm learning about it through therapy right now is i would rather have somebody hurt me  than me hurt them i would rather have somebody break up with me than me break up with them because i have an abandonment wound from my my father from  when i was younger and so what happens is sometimes i am in these  toxic relationships and i know i have to leave i see the red flags don't get me wrong i see them i'm not dumb like i'm  super self-aware i see the red flags but i try to paint them another color i do that because i don't want to leave that  person before they leave me because what if they need me or  what if i hurt them and i can't sit there with that hurt because my whole childhood all i did was carry on  everybody's emotions at the age of eight okay i was the age that aubrey's at right now  i was trying to get my parents to stay together and not divorce i was trying to get my dad to stay sober  i was carrying the weight of everybody else at    like you name it like me  so not only do i have a fear of abandonment because abandonment was scary growing up and what's scary  as kids is what leads over into our adulthood we have those same fears until we learn how to rewire them  but also in another sense me leaving somebody means that they're hurt and then that's  my responsibility you get what i'm saying so even if i'm in a relationship where i don't love the person or i don't like  them like sometimes i'll just stay with them because i feel bad not knowing that  you're not not only are you prolonging the inevitable but you're hurting them even more because they deserve to be with somebody who actually wants to be  with them and same with you you deserve to be someone who actually wants to be with you i don't do that anymore i learned my lesson but i'm learning in  therapy now and unpacking why i do that which is why it's very important that i'm like single right now so i can learn  these things before my next successful relationship because i'm meeting my husband this year okay point blank  period the end okay thank you thank you jesus so when i'm in vermont i am basically just  realizing that i don't love bobby but that i do still have love for damien and i'm conflicted and i don't  know what to do because in one sense i don't want to hurt this guy because i feel horrible and this is why it's very important to  when you get out of a relationship please don't jump into the next one please take the time to heal please listen to me after this relationship  with damien finally ended i was celibate and single for a year and a half i didn't touch a guide and kiss a guy go on a date nothing i'll go into more  depth with that in another video but i was celibate for a whole entire year you guys i didn't have sex i didn't kiss anybody didn't even talk to guys guys  for a [ __ ] year and a half almost two years i was completely celibate  and i could say since then i haven't had like a toxic relationship like even the last relationship i was in  when he broke up with me when i had kova in the hospital that wasn't like a toxic relationship that was just a  relationship where it was like you're not ready for me and  i should have left when i realized that because i should have it was more of a self-worth thing you know but it wasn't a toxic relationship um  so i did learn you know i'm learning little by little and that's all we can do at the end of the day is learn you know don't feel bad for your mistakes  just try to learn from them and be better anyway so i'm realizing this and the whole time  i'm out there damien is like please just when you get back home can we just please try to work on things can we please just try to  you know be together like i'll be the man that you need me to be and i basically told him i was like i'll think about it that's all i said was i think  about it okay well apparently i was taking too long to think because he decided that he was going to message  bobby and i literally almost [ __ ] my pants i was like what are you doing like he literally but he didn't actually do  it he messaged him and was like do you know who dakota cross is and then he deleted it and i'm just like he  screenshotted it to me just to scare me and i'm just like what is wrong with you so i'm like over here in vermont like  freaking out and i finally was like you know what dakota you have to pick you have to pick it's jake or it's jessie  like no i'm kidding it's damien or it's bobby so i told myself when i got back home i  was going to think about what i needed to do but i wanted to see  bobby one last time to see if i could somewhere in me install that connection and this night is truly what made me  realize that me and him could just never be together so  um after vermont we drove home and i went to bobby's house  and i went to bobby's house and i was trying to see if we could establish some sort of connection  and i was trying to see if i could love him i was trying to see if you know what dakota just just you know what i  actually did i forgot to mention this so when i was in vermont damien like i said  he just is great with like surprises so he had booked us a a room in new york  to go stay at and he was gonna drive us there we were gonna have like a little weekend getaway and like he booked it  and surprised me with it and i didn't know what to say because like i said in my mind i already decided that i still  loved him and i kind of wanted to make things work but i also wanted to give it just one more shot with bobby before i  made my final decision because i was like maybe i'm just saying that because i'm in vermont and i don't know you know what i'm saying so  i told him like i don't know i'll think about it so when i get to my mom's house i basically texted him and i was like  hey like i'm really sorry um but i i don't think i can take you up on your offer i think i really want to  see if me and bobby can work this out you know i want to give our relationship a try without you like butting in you  know what i mean and it wasn't going to work regardless i did not belong with bobby at all but i  don't know in my mind i just i felt so bad you know i was making excuses for myself instead of just ending it and not  prolonging the inevitable and hurting this kid even worse it's like i'm not letting you get out of the car until you tell me that and i was like i'm not  telling you that and basically we just ended up like talking in the car for  minutes and i  just told him i was like you just need to let me go and you need to let me let you go  like i have to do this like i just have to and he was so upset because he had just  booked this like super expensive hotel in new york and you guys know like new york prices like it's  to  just to  breathe when you get out of grand central station right it feels super bad but i felt like i was making the right decision  i just felt really bad for bobby but i knew that i should have just right then and there ended it the fact that like  like i said you can't love two people at once it's and if you you do it's because you don't love the first one as much as  you think you do and part of me should have said the fact that i even have to choose between the both of them  right now should be an indication right so i was just so concerned about other  people's feelings back then instead of worrying about myself but also realizing like i'm hurting him even more without  even without even really like it wasn't intentional ended up going over to bobbies and i was trying to make  it work i ended up having a really bad trip off edibles that night that was my first second time trying them  the first time was fine the second time was i had i don't know if i just had a bigger piece or like what um because it  was like a swedish fish and so a couple weeks before that i tried it and it i only took like this  much and then i only took this much again but it was like bigger so i didn't know that i actually technically took a  half and i just i guys i had the worst anxiety attack i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital and  he took care of me during that but then afterwards i felt like he just didn't care like he just wanted to like  go back to hanging out and i'm like i don't feel good like can we chill like i don't want to like  you know like hang out like i want to just like like i just want to like relax and so  i just knew right then and there that it like wasn't going to work like he was just more concerned about what he wanted  and instead of like my well-being and i feel like if damien was there he would have like really taken care of me  um because damian always took care of me so i found myself missing him and seeking comfort from him within that i remember  just going into bobby's bathroom and just like looking in the mirror and i was just like i can't do this anymore like i'm living a [ __ ] lie like i'm  literally living like a hannah montana like life so i ended up making an excuse that aubrey was sick and i ended up  leaving and i went home and on the way home i had texted bobby  basically telling him i made a mistake and this kid  this psycho was already on his way to my house him and his friends had gone out  to a bar he didn't drive him not even knowing i'm home not even talking to me not even knowing my  whereabouts or where i am or what i'm doing asked his friend to drop him off at my  house and his friend was like dude how do you even know she's home it's like one o'clock in the morning like shouldn't you call her first he's like i  just need to go there drop me off so i'm on the way home from bobby's and i'm texting him right and tell me why  i pull up into my driveway and this kid is in the middle of my road by himself  like by himself you guys he had his friend drop him off without him even knowing if i  was there or not without him even knowing if i was home and so i get out of the car and i'm like what are you doing here and i'm looking around  because i'm like his car has to be here somewhere so i'm looking around and i'm like where the [ __ ] is your car and he's  like i had my friend drop me off i just need to see you and i was like i wasn't even supposed to come home tonight because i wasn't i was supposed to  actually sleep at his house so i'm like how did you even know if i was gonna come home tonight that makes no sense and he's  like i just had a feeling and then you texted me i guess i had texted him as soon as he pulled up to my house like as  soon as he pulled into my house and he was like yeah see she just texted me just dropped me off like even if i didn't text him back he was gonna get  dropped off i'm like what is wrong with you like where do they do that app comes into my car so he come because i was not about to drive him home you guys it was  like one o'clock in the morning i had just gotten over you know that stuff that happened at bobby's like i did not want to drive him a half an hour to his  house i was like come in my car so he comes to my car and we start talking and he's like please just give me one more chance like i'll do anything like  let me show it to you like i know i messed up and i want to prove it to you and i'm basically not even hearing any of  that because in my mind i'm like what are we going to do with you because i'm not taking you home right now your friend just dropped you off and he told  i guess he told him like if i drop you off here i'm not coming to get you later it's like you better like make your decision if you want me to take you home  or let me take you to her house so i had no choice but to have him sleep at my house i had no choice because what was i  going to do like i couldn't drive him home i don't think uber was like was uber like a thing it had to have been a  thing i don't know it wasn't like a big thing though so he had to save my house and so i like literally told him i was like we're going to go on my house  you're going to sleep here i was like you're going to be quiet you're not gonna wake people up in my house okay and  like i have to sneak you in so i told him i was like we're not doing anything like i have a boyfriend we're not doing anything he's okay okay yeah i know so  we go in my house i sneak him in and luckily my staircase was like right by the door kate that by the door but he  was like drunk and he was being loud and i was like shut up so i just sneak him in i like throw him in my bed and i'm  like putting like a pillow between us so that way it's like oh i was a horrible person like  it's not really like i'm like sleeping with my ex-boyfriend you know like oh anyway so  this is the part right i hate talking i've been really roasting myself and spilling the tea on myself lately and  exposing myself within these videos um i think it takes courage to come onto the internet and number one tell stories  about things that happen in your life and other people in general but number two to tell stories about you and hold yourself accountable and say  where you went wrong i've yet to see another youtuber do that just saying so um  he came into the house and you know we fell asleep and he was like  super drunk and i just turned the tv on and i just let him go to sleep and then the next  morning there's no excuse whatsoever so i'm just going to say it  i cheated on bobby with damien it was a moment of weakness  i'm not laughing it's funny i'm like because i don't even know how to explain to you guys i feel like i sound like a [ __ ] boy who cheated like it was a  moment of weakness no you don't no like i could have said no i could have  told him you know let me take you home now like i could have i could have done a lot of things to prevent it but i  didn't and i [ __ ] up and it's guilt that i literally carry with me still to this day it was enough to the point  where i never did it again and i never will do it again i'm like i can't stand cheaters like i've been cheated on like  you know by adrian and by just like like so many relationships of mine and i hate  cheaters because of it because i'm like just [ __ ] break up you know um but i at the same point do believe that  cheaters can change because i only did it one time and i never [ __ ] did it again and i never will like uh it was  enough to make me be like dakota like this is so [ __ ] up to do this to another human being like  that like horrible like how dare you and i i learned from it and i never [ __ ] did it again ever like  never ever ever never would i again now i'm kind of in a sense glad that it did happen so that way i have understanding  of why like other people do it but also so that i know that like people can change if they really put the work in  because i put a lot of work into myself like i said i went celibate for a whole entire year after this so  i ended up cheating on bobby and i felt horrible and like i was just like crying and i'm like what is wrong with me  and i ended up taking damian home and i decided right then and there that no matter what i could not be with bobby  for one more second that it wasn't fair to him i was leading him on and no  matter how bad it was going to hurt him it was going to hurt him worse to have me stay and i ended up just telling him  that you know like i think you're a great guy and i really like you and i think that  you know you're gonna be a great boyfriend for a girl one day but unfortunately that girl just isn't me  and i want you to be with somebody that you actually have a genuine connection  with and that you can build with he was devastated you guys he was so upset and yeah i i was honest i told him  i was like i just i still have feelings for my ex and i didn't know it until i saw him and i'm really sorry and  you know what i take full blame it's not even him like it really is me and i apologize and  i just told him i was like i don't even think i should be in a relationship right now at that point younger dakota  should have not because she needed to get her mentalish together i thought by me staying even though i didn't feel the  connection anymore that i was not hurting him because by me breaking up with him that  would hurt him not realizing that by me staying and lying to myself  and living a lie and staying with somebody i know i shouldn't be with that's hurting him even more but it's also hurting me all  of this could have been avoided the cheating thing could have been avoided everything could have been avoided if i  realized while in the relationship for the first like month that  i just wasn't feeling it you know and that's why my biggest advice is that  if you're with somebody you don't feel like you have a true connection with because you know you know when you're with someone that you really  are rocking with okay and you're afraid to leave them because you don't want to hurt them you're hurting them even more by staying with  them and no matter how much it hurts them and breaks their heart when you leave they will be okay  and it will be better in the long run because you're not prolonging the inevitable you're not prolonging the hurt making them fall for you that much  more and then one day just completely crashing their worlds to the ground so all of this could have been avoided if i  had just listened to my intuition and addressed it from the beginning and nipped in the bud long story short i  ended up breaking up with him he was crushed i felt horrible i did end up giving damien a second chance not a  second chance we had broken up and gotten back a number of times but i gave him another chance and it didn't work out um like i  said you have to watch their story um long story short we just would fight and we just there was the trust wasn't  there and too many things had been happened to the point where at that point in our lives it was just gone  beyond repair and instead of separating and healing and maybe one day coming back together we stayed together while  we were toxic for one another and prolonged the inevitable in that  relationship and basically he had like gotten me like i said like this huge vanity mirror and then we  broke it up and he took it back and sold it to somebody else and i was like crushed about it and then one day he bought me like this big ass like big  screen tv because i have a tv in my room and one day we broke up and he came and he took it back and he played uh that  song on his iphone when he was taking the tv room where it's like [ __ ] you you ho i don't want you back  [ __ ] what i said it don't mean [ __ ] now [ __ ] the presents might as well throw  them out like he was playing i will never forget like a movie in my brain he was playing that all throughout my house  while taking apart this tv and bringing it to his car like literally like a lot  of things happen and we ended up finally ending like maybe two or three months later so yeah in conclusion  this was the time that i cheated for real and i regretted it still something i regret to this day  but i grew and i learned and i changed never made the same mistake again and never want to like it's just horrible  doing that to somebody and if you have them to somebody just know that you can change and you can learn from it and if you are doing  it to somebody and you didn't learn and change from it and you're still doing it  you my friend or not [ __ ] if
