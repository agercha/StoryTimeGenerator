so many people knew this because i guess  he was going around to everybody telling  everybody and their mother that he was  like people were like that doesn't  happen in real life it's not a thing  that people do like sweet home alabama  baby like that's not real why are you  doing that  hey  what's up so since my last video our  last story time was a little bit sad and  kind of depressing  um i wanted to like sit down and do one  of my regular weird ass story times  because i like filming these so and i  know you guys like watching them and i  randomly remembered this story this one  is old it is an old story so i'm not  that like sketch out about telling it  but it is weird as like it is really  weird i've like briefly mentioned this  story while i've been on like instagram  live talking to you guys so you know if  you don't follow me i'm just gonna plug  it real quick if you don't follow me on  instagram a lot of times i just tell  random stories while i'm on live so  wanna hang out with me go follow me on  instagram we can chitchat and i'll tell  you a bunch of weird it just happens to  me and because this is like my first  boyfriend i say that boyfriend very  loosely  i was  years old i was a freshman in  high school and this happened which  almost makes it like worse that this  happened like it's bad it is just all  bad all together that this even happened  to begin with but it is just bad that  this happened when i was  and he was   too so  and she was . all of us were  we  were all freshmen in high school gonna  give you the whole backstory of how i  met this person life in high school when  i was  years old okay so let's just  get in the story so i've mentioned this  a couple times in other videos but i  went to an all girls catholic high  school um and if you know anything about  that you know somebody that went to an  all girls catholic high school like you  know it's not all  holy up in there so  because we were all girls we had a  brother's school the brother school was  all boys they were like down the street  from us we had like mixing events and  stuff like that you had a chance to meet  people that were guys when we were   and like freshmen and they were like  mixing us all together doing like the  freshman mixers it was like feral  absolutely feral people were getting  into relationships like the second time  they met somebody not even the second  like i remember one time we had we went  to the fair in our state people were  like dating by the end of the day i was  like you guys met  minutes ago anyway  we had all these mixing events so that's  how i met this person this boy went to  my brother's school i'm just gonna  insert a picture in here for context i  will tell people that i was ugly growing  up and they're like no you how could you  be ugly which that's very sweet like  thank you but a girl was looking like a  wet bread like i looked so bad i had  hair up to here had not grown into my  nose whatsoever i was like extremely  thin i've always had really big teeth um  and i had full braces full metal mouth  going on i had these horrific side bangs  but that was like that was cool back  then so i'm not hanging out that much  but what's wild is during this time when  i looked like a tiny wet rat i got  probably more attention from guys than i  did when i had like my glow up i always  went to these mixers with the impression  that nobody was going to even give a  [ __ ] about me i i kind of was i was  self-aware that i was ugly because in  middle school when everybody was getting  into like their first little like and  they're both boys relationships that  were like a bunch of bs i was not  participating in that i did not get  picked by any i wanted one i wanted a  middle school little fling but like  nobody wanted me because we were in all  girls high school we didn't have  football games but most of us would  attend our brother's school's football  games they had a really good like  football team so the games are actually  pretty fun to go to um that was also an  opportunity for you to go meet boys and  i met this boy i thought he was super  cute this is not this is not the boy  that i'm gonna be talking about but i'm  just gonna give the full story i met  this boy and i thought he was super cute  and a bunch of the girls at the football  game were like oh my god he's so cute  i'm just going to call him i'll call him  t all the girls at this football game  were like oh my god he's so cute and i  was one of them but i was kind of had  this impression that i was like whatever  like he's not gonna pick me but i can  still look i don't know by the grace of  god why this guy thought i was  attractive in any shape or form but for  some reason he liked me i was hyped i  was so hyped and it was a definite  confidence booster so this guy doesn't  know this but like thank you you  actually like made me feel good about  myself when i did not feel good about  myself we like exchanged numbers and  like snapchats and all that even though  we were like brother and sister schools  like we were still separate schools so  there were separate homecomings and  there were separate like proms and  separate dances like separate events  like that there was kind of an  opportunity to go to two homecomings  like you go to your own and then if you  were invited you could go to your  brother's schools if somebody brought  you i was under the impression that like  this guy i'd been talking to was going  to take me to his homecoming and i was  so excited because you know homecoming's  like one of the first like big dances  that happens in the beginning of high  school and the brother schools  homecoming happened first before ours  and i got invited by this guy and i was  over the moon because like i said you  had to be like invited even though they  were our brother's school because one of  the guys had to take you and like so not  every girl at my high school got to go  but like a good chunk of them were going  because everybody was feral at that  point that's when my parents dropped the  bomb on me that for some reason we had  to go to chicago the weekend of my  brother's school's homecoming and i now  in hindsight it was not that big of a  deal but when you're that age and you  were like looking forward to something  and a boy had asked me kind of out it  kind of felt like the other world it did  feel like the other world i had a  meltdown i'll be honest  i was yelling  i was like no you can't make me go to  chicago i'm not going like why do we  have to go this weekend like my parents  like no you have to come because we have  to go and you're too young my brother's  even younger than me and i was like  absolutely not i'm not going like you  can't make me go i'll go stay with  grandma like please i was freaking out  and they were like this is not a big  deal because it wasn't my homecoming  they didn't really care because there  were two opportunities to go homecoming  brother's school in the sister school  and i didn't go to the brother school to  me too  me to me  yes i did have to go to both of them  long story short i did not get my way  and i ended up going to chicago so i had  to tell this guy i remember snapchatting  and being like so like i have to go to  chicago with my parents this weekend but  i can't go to homecoming with you but  like i still really like you he did not  give i was a little heartbroken i  remember being in chicago seeing all the  pictures of like all of the girls the  new friends i had made in high school i  was like sitting in a hotel room with my  brother in chicago viewing i wanted to  know so badly of who the guy took that  was supposed to take me t so i'm like  stalking t's instagram to be like who  did he take who did he take i heard  rumors of who he was taking  but i was like who did this guy end up  going take it i was hoping he was gonna  wait for me and not go to his homecoming  like what in the delusion but he went he  took somebody else and the other girl  really liked him so i kind of just gave  up  um i wasn't much of a fighter then i  wasn't gonna go fight for this man i  barely knew him i just thought he was  cute so so then i ran into the issue of  okay he's been stolen this other girl  went to homecoming with him he's a  stolen man we're not really talking  anymore at this point and i don't know  anybody and i wasn't going to be one of  those people that was going to take  somebody that they went to middle school  with so one of the girls that went to my  high school she had posted her  homecoming pictures from the brother  school homecoming and the guy that she  went with was really cute and i was like  oh i wonder if she likes him or if they  just went as friends but like i want to  figure out what's going on here because  i like this guy i'm not a homeworker  i've never been i wasn't gonna go  sabotage anything but i just wanted to  know what her vibes were like if you  don't want him i'll take him so call  this guy zach we'll call this guy zach i  was trying to be like sly but i was like  talking to people i was like so do you  think that um katie's gonna take zach to  homecoming cause zach took her people  like i don't think she likes him like  that and i was like oh okay i go to  another football game i see zach there  katie's not talking to him not  interacting with him i'm just kind of  standing there and i think somehow i  like like weaseled my way into like a  big group conversation that he was in  zack starts talking to me and he was  like very forward about it too like  there was not really like does he like  he does not he like immediately  gravitated towards me and then kind of  like separated from the group  conversation to like just talk to me we  were like hitting it off he was super  nice um this is a picture from this  exact night so this is what i looked  like i don't know why anybody was into  this gremlin looking ass cat  i had  going on but so after the football game  like we continued talking again really  sweet was like i thought you looked  really beautiful tonight like the corny  and but i was eating it up i was eating  all that up so i get back to school on  monday i  wanted to ask him to homecoming i was  like okay i really like this guy i want  to ask for homecoming but i did not want  bad blood with anybody i did not want to  come into high school and like cause any  problems this is so ironic now that i'm  editing this but after i graduated high  school like a couple weeks after katie  literally  tried to beat me up  literally tried to beat me up for no  reason like literally for no reason i  did i like don't really know her that  well i didn't really know that her wet  well and i was at a like party thing and  she tried picking me up  i straight up asked katie i was like hey  i've been talking to zach i feel like  you're not talking to him anymore but i  just want to double check do you want to  take him to our homecoming totally  understand if you do i will back off  immediately and she immediately was like  oh hell no i don't like him you can have  him like have fun and i was like okay  thank you  i asked her the homecoming in the most  corniest way i asked when homecoming the  most corny corny way the following  weekend at the next football game we  literally would only interact with the  football games because it was just like  every friday the football game in the  fall it went you mingled i was like okay  this friday i'm gonna ask zach to  homecoming so i took a little piece of  like printer paper and i got like a  little bottle of fanta like the orange  soda and i wrote like it would be  fantastic but like i cut out the word  like fanta in it to go to homecoming  with you and i just like got there i was  so awkward about it i'm so awkward i  just got there and i was like hey  leave me by the bleachers on like the  left side or whatever i told them where  to meet me i pulled out the piece of  printer paper like all folded up and  gave like the little soda and he said  yes we took this picture of me he was  giving me a piggyback ride and my  friend's like oh my god this is so cute  hi  no thank you  the picture was on my instagram but it  is gone now so if you cannot figure out  who this is it's been gone for years so  no no digging this guy is not on my  instagram anywhere homecoming rolls  around i'm super excited i get all  dressed and everything we have this like  group homecoming dinner before my  parents meet his parents he's super nice  he can like really like people please  parents nothing was bad about this at  all so we get to the dance it's at the  aquarium  and we like walk around the aquarium  together it's like all romantic  everybody's in like their dresses also  i'm just gonna put this in here i just  totally forgot my mom i think is a  sidekick my mom has called so many  things she's like you're gonna get your  first kiss tonight i'm like no i'm not  mom like she called it um she's called  so many other things anyway i get out of  the car before go to the dance my mom's  like you're gonna have your first kiss  tonight and i was like no i'm not i'm  not gonna have my first kiss by the end  of the night they put on like a slow  song this is so corny we put on a slow  song we're like slow dancing and he like  leans in to kiss me and we had our first  kiss and then right there he's like will  you be my girlfriend  what in the absolute wattpad fanfic i  felt like i was not in real life so  after the dance i get back in my mom's  car she picks me up and she's like how  was it and i told her everything i was  like oh my god he kissed me and he asked  me to be his girlfriend like i'm so  excited and we've been like texting  already like he said he had such a great  night with me  we were texting constantly all  throughout like the school day after  school he'd always plan like okay friday  we're gonna go to the football game  we'll hang out there and everything or  sometimes it's a saturday but we always  plan to go to the football games like  meet up that was like the only time we  would like hang out it was so juvenile i  saw like once a week for like three  weeks and then the relationship was over  but this is what i'm trying to get out  here this guy had no red flags but also  i had negative two experience with any  of this so they may have just gone over  my head i really don't know two weeks  later like one friday for whatever  reason i decided i did not want to go to  one of the football games i don't know  why i didn't want to go because i knew  he was gonna be there i don't think  anything happened i don't think i wanted  to go i think i was tired and then this  is when i first started experiencing  fomo which still wrecks me to this day i  will plan on not going to something and  the second i see people having fun i'm  like  mom you gotta drive me there right now  so my friends are all there they're all  sending me snapchats and then i find out  that zach is there and i was like  i messed up  so i speed get ready and i'm like mom i  actually decided i want to go to the  football game can you take me also this  is crazy i was deleting my voicemails i  for some reason still have a voicemail  from this night this is what i'm talking  about fomo i was laughing because  there's like no context to this but but  it's like time stamp  in september i  knew exactly what this voicemail was it  was somebody trying to get me to come to  the football game  i'm at the football game right now and  about you so um should really  start texting me right now okay i'm on  my sped over there i get out i'm like  with all my friends and everything i  can't find zach everybody was like  hanging out in the same area and i  didn't see zach and i knew he was there  because i got pictures i got that  voicemail like i knew he was there so i  was texting him i was like where are you  he's not replying to me so i started  asking a couple of my friends who said  they were with him or sent me snapchats  and i'm like where is he and they were  like i don't know like he was just here  and then this kid comes over to me i  knew him growing up and then he went to  my brother's school so like i had known  this person for a while he comes up to  me and he's like hey i need to tell you  something i was like okay he goes so i  know you're dating zach but i just want  to let you know that he's been like  getting really close to some other girl  like i don't think she goes to your high  school or our high school i don't know  who she is but like aren't you dating  him and i was like yeah we're dating he  was like he was getting really close to  this girl so i just want to warn you i  was like whatever dude like i don't  maybe it was just like his friend or  whatever blah blah blah i didn't want i  didn't want the fantasy to end so i just  kind of ignored it zach is still not  replying to my tech i know he's here i  can't find him the high school the  football game was at was massive so he  could have been like anywhere i  i don't know where he was eventually  zach ends up coming back to the big  crowd where i was and everybody else was  i was like where were you and he was  like oh i was just wandering around like  i didn't even know you were here and i  was like yeah i've been texting you like  i didn't even ask him about the girl  that my friend was referring to because  i really didn't want to make things  awkward so i we just continued the rest  of the evening like it was normal i went  home monday comes and texting him he's  like not replying very well i start  hearing less and less from him and  eventually he just stops replying and  another day goes by and like another day  goes by still haven't gotten a single  text from him i'm not blowing up his  phone but i'm like hey just want to make  sure you're good like my boyfriend just  stops replying all together i really  didn't know who to talk to to be like  why isn't zach replying so i just kind  of let it go and i never heard from him  again legitimately i never got another  text from this guy again  um so that's like how we like broke up i  didn't go to the football game i think  that weekend because i was upset i think  i was being petty i was like this dude  won't even reply to me i'm not even  going to like go to the football game on  the chance that i see him like i don't  even want to talk to him so i didn't go  still no text i never hear from this guy  again so i got back to school on monday  after i skipped out on going to the last  football game i think it was like the  last one possibly i don't quite remember  the football games were not that crucial  it was just like the meeting spot where  i would see zach everybody is talking  about how zach told everybody that he's  been [ __ ] his stepsister  and  i was like  excuse me and more people and more  people were like yeah yeah like he was  talking about it at the football game  he's been like telling guys that he goes  to school and like a lot of the girls  were dating other guys at the brother  school where zach went it was basically  like we were in the same high school so  like yeah jack told me that zach was  telling everybody and like yeah i also  heard that like so many people knew this  because i guess he was going around to  everybody telling everybody and their  mother that he was being his stepsister  because they weren't blood oh  hell no so this man decides to ghost me  never speak to me again out of literally  nowhere and then i find out from  literally half my high school that um he  is hooking up with his step-sister when  is it my turn to be happy i text him one  more time and i'm trying to get a hold  of him i didn't even say that i knew  anything about it i just texted him one  more time and i was like hey and the  text didn't deliver  did he block me like what is going on i  just gave up at that point i was like  this dude is a weirdo he doesn't want  anything to do with me clearly i guess  he's more occupied with his stepsister  um keep in mind i just had my first kiss  with this person and then two weeks  later i guess he's um canoodling with  his family members that makes me feel  great  so  i know there's probably people that are  gonna be like there's no way there's  nothing i have proof the only form of  proof i have because this happened so  long ago i've had multiple phones i  don't have text messages from . the  only proof is i posted on my finsta one  time that has all my personal friends on  it i posted just being like lol remember  when my first boyfriend like ended up  like  his stepsister does anybody remember  that two people commented i'll block out  their name two people commented they  went to high school with me they go oh  my god i remember when people told me  about his stepsister and i was like holy  [ __ ] brooke dodged a bullet another kid  who went to high school with him was  like did he go to the high school that  they went to because i know exactly who  you're talking about i guess he thought  it was like cool he was like high five  bro like  my step-sister what's up like people  were like that doesn't happen in real  life it's not a thing that people do  like sweet home alabama baby like that's  not real why are you doing that months  later the brother school would have  these like informal dances like you  didn't have to be invited to go you just  had to go to either my school or their  school and that was the first time that  i had seen zach since we broke up i've  never told him that i knew how do you  even bring that up i just don't know how  to bring that up in casual conversation  at all and it was so awkward when we saw  each other the next time because we were  dating and then he just never replies to  me again i did ask about that though i  went up to him and i was like hey  hey  [Music]  he told me that his phone broke  he told me that his phone broke he said  that he dropped his phone it shattered  and it took him like multiple weeks to  get a new one and he like i think he  told me he still didn't have a new phone  yet it was the weirdest response i bet  like we just never talked again  i ended up like never really having to  interact with zach again because he  ended up getting kicked out from our  brother's school is what i was told i  heard that he got kicked out for selling  weed and then my freshman year of  college i came home for the summer we  still had each other on social media  once again i told you i never told him  that i knew i kind of just acted like i  didn't know he texts me and he goes i've  been seeing your insta lately like  you're not the little girl that i used  to know and i was like  he was like so like when are we gonna  hang out sir  sir  it has been four years and i know that  you  did very bad things with your step  sister i have no desire of ever hanging  out with you um i just never replied and  then i think he unfollowed me on  instagram because i think he was salty  but yeah that is the story of how  my first boyfriend that i ever had  cheated on me with his stepsister  if you guys like the story make sure to  give it a big thumbs up
