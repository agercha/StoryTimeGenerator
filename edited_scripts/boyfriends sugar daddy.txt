no hair under here i will probably  post that video after this one but  i  cut all my hair off again actually i  didn't cut it all myself i actually went  to a salon and i showed her this  i showed her this picture i was like  girl you got to give me the rihanna i'm  trying to grow my hair out but i don't  want to be bald this time and like wigs  are just not my thing she itches the  scalp gets very very dry she's like  don't worry i got you i've been cutting  men's hair forever and i'm like  i have a lot of experience  and i should be able to work my magic on  you it was a baddie like i don't know if  she's gonna watch this video somehow  this woman was a baddie like she was  that girl that woman so i just really  trusted her  um and  it's not giving rihanna all i have to  say is when they take a ton of photos of  you and they post all their other  clients but they don't post you that's  how they know they [ __ ] up so we're  going to be wearing this wig today this  was made by  this wig was made by mac wigs at lisa  mac  um i found her on instagram i reached  out to my girlies and i was like y'all i  need a wig she's battered she's torn so  she will be making an appearance later  on in the video i don't like to do my  makeup with my wig on because if you can  tell like i've gotten foundation on the  wig so i don't want to make that even  worse she's going to lay right here on  my hello kitty pillow until she's needed  today's video is going to be a get ready  with me hopefully right i hope  my girl don't go out looking like that  so today's gonna be a get ready with me  slash a story time that i tried to film  this video like a month and a half ago  and consecutively every other week i  kept trying to film it just something  kept going wrong like the first time the  audio got [ __ ] up the second time my  friend said i shared way too many  details so told me to film it again  filmed it a third time and the audio got  [ __ ] up again so here we are again for  the fourth time trying to share this  story maybe that's the universe telling  me that this man is gonna try to sue me  so for the sake of defamation everything  i'm about to tell you is a lie i totally  came up with all this in my head okay  sweetie so today we're gonna do a very  light beat i have absolutely no plans  and nothing to do per usual but i like  to do my makeup and get ready in the  morning because it just genuinely makes  me feel better so why not chat with the  girlies show off my new growth so this  story takes oh by the way like when i do  my get ready with me if you're new to my  channel i don't sit here like here's  each product like girl i'm not a beauty  guru you guys are here getting ready  with me i hope you're not learning from  me actually had somebody tell me oh my  god vanessa i want to be a makeup artist  because you taught me how to do makeup  and i never felt more lied to in my life  like it made me feel so good but at the  same time i was like damn y'all really  out here lying  okay let's get into this makeup also  you're gonna notice me like fidgeting  with my eye a lot i don't know what  happened but like i ripped off my false  lash and i try to rip off the glue  afterwards but i actually ripped the  skin off my eye you're probably  wondering how the [ __ ] does that happen  vanessa but like i literally ripped all  the skin on my lash line so we're  probably not gonna do lashes today so  this story takes place all the way back  in  so this was quite a while ago  that's why i feel comfortable sharing  i'm not really  in connection with any of these people  so if anybody decides to pop up then  i  i don't know what to tell you i'm also  in the bible like if you've done me like  severely wrong in the past yeah i can  move and grow past it but like if i want  to share my story my experience i'm  gonna share it and  you should have done me wrong so this  was around the era when  i have many many questionable eras this  was my european era when i thought that  i could fly overseas and find a man  i thought i could fly overseas and bag  me a fish  it just ended a very  rollercoaster relationship with somebody  from overseas and a [ __ ] was feeling  lonely a bit just feeling desperate she  wanted some attention and like [ __ ]  cassie from euphoria i took the  attention from where i shouldn't have  ladies and gentlemen i've said this in  several videos not all attention is good  attention and you know what sometimes we  find ourselves in positions and  you know we bite the bait this was one  of those moments when i bit the bait um  somebody that i dated previously before  my european era  um this man used cheated lied the whole  i don't even know i am smiling [ __ ] it  was a mess he really thought he was the  [ __ ] in la and i thought i was the [ __ ]  under his arm even though i was paying  for all his ubers paying for all his  uber eats  paying for all his clothes paying  his mom man did me wrong he found a  whole model from miami had her fly out  dumped me the day before she showed up  for whatever [ __ ] reason being the  dumb [ __ ] i was after that situation  went away i decided to try again and i  flew out to go and meet all his family  and stuff and he ended up leaving me in  a hotel room the entire time so it was  very full circle so your girl moved on  she moved past it and of course like i  said i bit the bait and my dumbass ended  up  in  you know  this person's life again we were talking    like from waking up to going to  sleep like calling up face time  . i  knew this person was on the other side  of the country but they did tell me that  they were always in la and at the time i  was flying in and out of la literally  like every month every couple weeks  because i was working on music  this was like around like the meditate  time so you know we figured that  whenever we were in la at the same time  we would link up or so i thought because  here i go you know flying out to l.a  letting them know i'm gonna be out there  so if at any point like you're gonna be  there too i'm gonna be there for maybe a  week and they made it seem like they  were constantly like in and out of the  city type thing so  which i don't know where the [ __ ] they  got all this money from because like i  said like the situation that i knew them  in was not you know an ideal one but all  of a sudden they were acting like you  know  they're up like they're successful they  got their mental health together they  got their everything together so that's  why i also entertained it like not only  because the bedroom lonely but because  you know  they spoke up a lot but you have to  remember that like people can talk a lot  they can really talk a bit of themselves  but if they don't show you then  kind of spill to my friend that i let  this person in my life again and i've  been talking to them and of course  they're like girl you better be careful  like you already know what happened last  time and me being you know me at the  time i was like oh i know what i'm doing  and then  you did not know what you were doing you  were  what  or . i did not know what i was  doing i really thought i knew everything  at that age so as i'm telling them about  this person they're looking at their  social media of course like you know let  me see what my [ __ ] is talking to  basically  and they're like oh my god they're in la  are you guys like meeting up soon and i  was like i did not know they were in la  what are you talking about and they  showed me a story and it was a very  obvious  landmark  from hollywood  so i was like oh my god like why didn't  he tell me that he was going to be in  l.a like i've been telling him for the  last you know a couple of weeks that i  was going to be out here so my friend  was like you should try to like reach  out and see if you guys can hang out i  have some stuff to do today anyway so  you guys should try to link or something  so it's like okay let's do that i hit  them up and immediately they're like oh  i meant to tell you that i was going to  be in l.a like i don't know why i didn't  tell you like it just slipped my mind i  was going to but we've been talking like    so like you're calling me at    am  p.m  p.m   p.m like where did it slip your mind i  was like why wouldn't you tell me and he  was like oh you know like it was just  slip of the mind so me being trusting  for whatever reason and like okay  maybe he's you know telling the truth  and he just forgot to tell me so i just  let it go and i'm like hey do you want  to hang out  and then here comes all the [ __ ]  excuses oh i don't think i can hang out  today like i don't want the person i'm  staying with to think that i'm using  them for a place to stay like you know  i've been here for a couple days and  i've been out and about so in my head  i'm like oh okay that makes sense like  you don't want your friend to feel like  you're only  there for a place to stay i mean me  personally if i were to ever stay like  steven's apartment and i had plans to go  hang out with you know someone else he  wouldn't even question it he wouldn't  feel weird about it because i used to  always stay at stephen's house  but i mean everybody's different i guess  so this kept happening for a couple days  like it was just a constant excuse of  like i can't get out like i don't want  this person to feel some sore way but  i'm only gonna be here for a week we  have you know been talking and you're  telling me that you want to be my man  again and you're telling me i'm not just  saying all this stuff spitting games so  i'm thinking like  this person would want to you know try  to see me but they're making it very  obvious that they were avoiding me in a  way that's how i felt so like you're  saying all this stuff over the phone but  like now we're literally only like   minutes away from each other so why  wouldn't you want to hang out with me so  just constant constant excuses so fast  forward i'm hanging out with that same  friend again in the hotel room and he's  like oh like i have an idea you should  film this video with them  so i reach out to them and conveniently  even though they couldn't hang out any  other time convenience like oh yeah i  could pop up right now i'll be there   minutes like oh okay now you're ready to  just show up because you're gonna  probably benefit from this somehow and  in that moment like i should have just  walked away completely but leaving me  after we filmed a video my friend ends  up leaving to go do whatever they were  doing at the time and he asked me like  oh do you want to go and get some food  in glendale so we went to the galleria  um kind of like area when i got some  xiao long bao from  is it called den tai fung it's like a  soup dumpling thing oh my god it's so  good that's my favorite food i'm not  gonna turn down my favorite food but the  whole time i'm just embarrassed and i'm  like oh my god why am i here why am i  doing this like no no he kept trying to  be flirty and trying to hold my hand and  [ __ ] and i just like i don't know i just  felt some sort of way after he leaves  one of my girlfriends came over and we  were just you know talking or whatever  and i kind of mentioned to her that  you know i was talking to him again a  little bit she already knew who he was  and this was like a newer friend so this  was a newer relationship so i kind of  told her a little bit about it but i  didn't tell her too much so what  happened next was very very confusing to  me and this girl literally is an fbi  agent a cia like not actually she's not  hired by them but if she applied i  wouldn't be surprised if she did because  i don't know how the [ __ ] she like  somehow put this all together while  we're hanging out she's just glued to  her phone the entire time and i'm like  this [ __ ] is up to something like i  just know she's up to something because  every time she's glued to her phone like  this she's gonna have to show me  something or like something's gonna pop  off and it's la so something is always  constantly popping off obviously not the  entire l.a county is like wild in but  like the community of people i was in  um yeah something was always popping off  so after her being glued to her phone  for like an hour and a half she's like i  have somebody that i want you to meet  and i have something i want to show you  something i want to tell you but i can't  tell you yet until you meet them and i'm  just like where are you on like this is  suspicious and i kept asking her a  million times and she would just keep  saying like no like you just have to  wait till you meet the person like [ __ ]  this better be [ __ ] justin  bieber okay like says i better pull up  because you are acting like this is the  most mysterious like like who are you  about to oh my god the eyeliner ain't  even sticking the skin is  the skin is rotting on my eye right now  but we're still gonna go ahead and try  to put some on anyways oh my god  probably shouldn't be doing this but you  know what um  i need it so the whole time that i'm  hanging out with her i'm also texting  him and i'm like i don't know why but  like she's being really sus right now  she's telling me that she has something  to show me and immediately like his tone  changes and he's like what do you mean  she has something to show you like she  has something like what are you talking  about i'm like whoa chill like why are  you getting all like freaked out now  like this this ain't even really your  friend like why are you concerned he  tried to play it off but he made it very  obvious that he was concerned about  something so now i'm like [ __ ] what's  going on because my friend about to like  introduce me to his like real girlfriend  or something like you know i'm thinking  about everything but  what happened i'm just chilling for like  an hour upstairs and eventually she  tells me okay we need to go downstairs  there's somebody that i want to  introduce you to which i'm excited i'm  like oh my god like i'm literally like  nervous sweating like oh my god like am  i gonna meet like like who is this am i  gonna get jumped like i don't know  waiting for us outside of the hotel  lobby is this older man and not like  older older as of like   i'm talking  about maybe like late s early s he's  in a big poncho he's like super wrapped  up big ass hat i'm like who is this man  like where did who is this man she's  just telling me like just play it cool  like just be nice to him like i'll let  you know everything afterwards i'm like  what the [ __ ] am i getting into like she  wants to bring him into my hotel room  like who is this man he's like you guys  want to smoke like we can go outside and  roll up and just walk around i'm like  who is this man but i kind of like you  already because you got what i like we  go outside we're just walking around the  hotel walking around you know like the  burbank glendale area  and just talking or whatever he was a  really really nice guy so i didn't have  any you know red flags or anything but  the same time i was like who is this guy  you know i'm just making small talk  telling him like a little bit of who i  am he's telling me that he's like an  entrepreneur and like tech and stuff and  he sold his company and he just kind of  chills every day because  he sold his company and he's sitting on  cash so i'm like oh good for you he only  stayed for maybe like   minutes like  literally came to smoke and then left  and i was like okay  what the [ __ ] was that keep in mind  before the guy showed up i smoked when  the guy showed up i smoked when he left  i smoked so i'm literally just fried out  of my mind like what the hell is going  on  i've been in so many random situations  so i don't even get scared anymore i'm  just kind of like  going with the flow of things and my  friend proceeds to tell me that that guy  is the one who  the person that i was talking to my  boyfriend quote unquote trying to be my  boy but he was telling me like leave  that ring finger empty i see you it's it  when i see you it's just us like you  know that whole conversation so she  basically tells me that that is the  person that he's been staying with this  entire time and i'm like okay how the  [ __ ] did you find him  like where like how even never explained  to me how she did this girl just had her  ways i genuinely do not know how she  found him to this day i don't know and i  can't get in connection with a man nor  would i want to  maybe she did some digging through his  photos and his followers and somehow  found him i legitimately cannot answer  it for you guys and i know some of you  are like that just doesn't make sense  like how i don't know she proceeds to  tell me like this is the man that dunano  has been staying with this is the guy  that's been paying for all his ubers  paying for his meals pancreas  in the background but she's like yeah  that's the reason why he hasn't been  able to hang out with you because he's  been staying with this guy and i'm like  what do you mean this man has been  paying for all his ubers all that stuff  he's the keynote he said he was an  investor is he investing in him for  something like what's going on like i  just didn't want to put two and two  together but she's like [ __ ] that's a  sugar daddy  like that is a sugar daddy did you pay  for your meal when you guys went out and  i said no i didn't she's like and when  did he get a job  see i was wondering where the money came  from i'm telling you we were throwing  this salad in this side another round  another round of dumplings another round  i was wondering oh how many rounds can i  do before the card gets declined  i don't know i just wanted to believe  everything he was saying he never know  anything about it he never really told  me what he was doing but he just said  like i got my [ __ ] together i'm up i got  my apartment had a hellcat all of a  sudden had just literally like i don't  know why i [ __ ] believe it i should  have assumed he was probably scamming or  somebody else was funding it ah she's  telling me all this i'm literally just  like like i said i'm trying out on my  mind so i'm just confused  i feel betrayed  i didn't feel betrayed like there's  nothing to be embarrassed about like if  that's the route that you want to go  that's the route you want to go and like  you know just  share like come on yoga holy crap daddy  who's like paying for everything like he  put you up in this apartment he's paying  for your car like share  i'm your girl right share i'm gonna give  a damn if i do youtube let me hold some  jada waida still gets a bag and that  [ __ ] is rich on her own a little baby  we don't gotta give her money but he  still does hello there's like girl i'm  gonna need you to come back in the  morning because this is just  this isn't just this isn't processing  right walk her down to her car she ends  up leaving and i go back up into my room  and i'm just sitting there  just very very confused for the next  couple of hours at this point i decide  you know what even though i'm right out  of my mind and i'm probably gonna you  know  get caught up let me try to go around  the question and somehow get some  answers so i'm asking him stuff like  where exactly are you staying again what  city was zip code who were you staying  with um what's the name of the person  you're staying like just asking all  these questions and he's like why are  you like asking me all this stuff all of  a sudden like you didn't care i'm like  oh i don't know i'm just asking like i'm  wondering and he wouldn't give me an  answer kept going around like i'm just  staying with one of my friends i'm like  but who and he's like it doesn't matter  so of course i hung up the phone why is  this man lying to me like why won't he  just tell me he's with like that's the  reason our relationship ended in the  first place because there was no trust  because of what he did so i'm like why  are you like giving me the ring around  rosie i just end up cutting the convo  for that day because girl i had to wake  up early i had music that i wanted to be  i looked like darcy from darcy and stacy  if you know the show you know the show  so i just cut the combo for that day  because the next day i had things that i  had to work on like i had music i wanted  to make i had to be in the right mindset  like i had had people to see things to  do i couldn't be flustered most likely  gonna put a hat on so i'm not really  concerned about the top of this right  now finally i get out of the studio i'm  like you know what let me go ahead and  answer this man's call so i do and  immediately he's like yelling at me on  the phone like where are you like why  are you not picking up all of a sudden  you're acting sus like after last night  our conversation like you just switched  up on me or i'm not about to have this  man yell at me on the phone because my  ex thought he could yell at me on the  phone from   miles away but you're  not about to do it from  miles down  the road  no so i'm like so who's  i bring up the guy's name and  immediately silence i'm like oh all of a  sudden you don't have anything to say  who is  this man  hangs up the phone but my thing is like  don't do it if you're embarrassed  like own your [ __ ] found something like  hey i'm going to come over to a hotel so  we could talk or whatever so i'm like  okay sure so i'm thinking they're going  to pull up by themselves it's just going  to be us you know to discuss everything  that's been going on because like i said  a [ __ ] has been feeling very lied to  you so  he pulls up and i'm thinking that he's  going to be by himself but of course he  brings his annoying ass friend this  friend like his claim to flame came to  flame his claim to fame was going around  la and telling people he had this song  that was produced by this guy and this  guy and keep in mind he was telling me  that from the day that i met him like  that was his thing the song never came  out i was just talking talking talking  the whole time like hey like thank you  so much for letting me sleep on your  couch like a year and a half ago and i'm  like yeah that was interesting so i  don't know if he brought his friend to  try to like defuse something or try to  like distract me but i kid you not the  whole time his friend is just blabbing  blabbing vibing about this opportunity  and this and we should go get drinks and  we should pop bottles of ro  and then  what are you talking about and i'm just  looking at my boo like  like  like what's going on and i pulled him to  the side and i said i'm sorry but like  you need to stay here and i need to talk  to your homeboy so i pull him away we go  to the pool area and we're talking and  he basically is in denial about  everything all of a sudden him and his  friend have a party they gotta go to and  they leave why the [ __ ] did i even  answer his goddamn dm yearly or what the  [ __ ] is wrong with you vanessa like what  is wrong with you i can't remember which  holiday it was but i know it was during  the summer time and he's like oh i'm  going to fly you out like we're going to  do a bunch of like you know like  yachting and we're going to be on boat  so we're going to grill out it's going  to be a good time in my head i'm like  you know what it's an experience to go  and network i don't have any friends  right now let me go and try you know  social butterfly or something make some  connections he said it's going to be a  bunch of influencers models  investors like you know inventors  entrepreneurs so i'm thinking okay this  might be something i want to go to like  also for you know the connections so i  told him yeah i'm down to do it like  that could be fun i didn't really have  anything going on at the time so i told  him yes let's do that the whole texting  and facetiming thing happened for maybe  about a week and a half to two weeks and  then boom ghost again he unfollowed me  on everything so i'm like okay what's  going on because i'm supposed to be  flying out soon right i go and check his  instagram i don't see anything i go and  check twitter i don't find nothing i go  on his ticktalk account and he posts a  video with this really really pretty  girl like i'm not going to talk [ __ ] on  her like she's a really beautiful girl  um  and it's her like in the car with him  and he's like oh i love my girlfriend  road tripping with my girlfriend  i'm just sitting there like damn  play it again [ __ ]  how you let the same person play that  many times i let him know that i saw  everything i saw and he's a piece of  [ __ ] and never hit me up again and  that's that i mean a couple months later  i did end up meeting anthony so i would  have had no reason to end up you know  talking to this person again but  i was just like really again bamboozled  so ladies and gentlemen i guess like the  lesson like there's always a lesson at  the end of my story times right so this  lesson would be if people show you who  they are  the first  and the second time because i know that  um  why is she all the way up there  oh my god i don't like the way it's  making my head look very oblong so i  think i said i guess the lesson is if  someone shows you who they are one time  and two times because if you're a  forgiving [ __ ] like me if they show you  literally the second time who they are  and you still look past it then  i i don't know what to tell you at that  point you're just playing yourself  yeah  that's it for today's video if you  enjoyed the story and my misery  subscribe i tell a lot of story times on  tik tok at messinessie  but i realized  like why am i not  filming them on my youtube channel  anymore i'm gonna go and show my makeup  off to my couch now  subscribe i'll see you guys in a couple  days bye
