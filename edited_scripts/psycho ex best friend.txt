hey guys welcome back to my channel and if you're new here hey girlies so today's video is going to be a story time about my psycho ex best friend  obviously like I'm  years old now relationships are a lot different from the past where it was drama over a dumb  boy or something know this girl like like I could see why people act certain ways and I know for sure why this girl  is acting out in the way she is I'll give you guys my theory at the end of the video but like I'm able to like get  over petty little [ __ ] because like a friendship means more to me than like little tiny problems that we can solve  because like near like  I would have turned like a little thing into like a huge thing but now it's  I'm older and  like I don't like I'd rather just solve our problems we'd be friends again like I don't care the stuff that this girl  did to the extent of contacting family members going after my ex-boyfriend and doing really crazy stuff like that that  is not okay to me and that's when we start having a problem so this story starts at first Friday in August so let  me like explain what first Friday is real quick in case you don't know so here in Arizona at downtown Phoenix they do this like a little like music our  food like a little like festival kind of thing like nothing big it's literally just like a road downtown that like  people will like that like food trucks and there's like people that can hypnotize you there's like art shows and  like just like different things going on every first Friday of the month so like last week they had the first Friday and  that's actually where I met my ex boyfriend that like I'm going to mention in this story I need a lot of people there like I usually will go with like  one or two friends and then they bring some of their friends and then those people bring some friends and then we end up having like this big group of us  just like walking around chillin laughs and I'm like talking and stuff last time I actually with my front guy hypnotized  and I think I posted it on my snapchat story but like he actually felt like he couldn't control himself like it has  nothing to do the story so I met this girl at First Friday me and my friends were standing at lion I really don't remember what we were purchasing I  wasn't buying anything I think one of my friends was getting like a snow cone or like a hot dog or something at like a truck I'm not sure but this lady was  going around selling like prayer books and stuff yes I ended up buying one because like I like got guilted into it  I don't know where the book quit but I ended up buying her prayer book and then this girl came up to me from like my ride she's like oh - like I love your  often I love your look like this is so cute keep in mind I wasn't looking cute that day like this was when I was still  wearing wigs almost every single day and my weave like melting into my away I think this girl just had to be nice and like I to  make conversation cuz I was fully aware of like how shitty I looked I was sweating it was very gross it was nasty  outside and I would just look nasty this girl came up to me what are we gonna like call her gonna call her Chelsea her  name is not jealous me but I've been like thinking of the name Chelsea a lot recently for some reason and I mean like that's what I named the spider from the  last video so we're gonna go ahead and call this girl Chelsea like I said Chelsea came up to me she's like complimenting me and stuff and I'm like  oh she's a cute girl too like hey girl like you look cute too like I love you feel like whatever she's asking me like are you here with your friends or  whatever I'm literally here by myself which was a red flag for me like that was the first red flag why is Chelsea by herself like I don't  really like like it's a big festival and I guess like you could make friends but like you don't really go to first Friday  alone unless you're like going to like purchase art like you know exactly where you're going therefore but if you're just like chilling around like walking  around by yourself like it's not like the typical thing that you do but I mean like I'm not gonna knock her for that but I mean like I know now why she was  by her so nothing but I'm about to share with you guys you're gonna be like yeah that's probably why she didn't have any presence supercedes to tell me that  she's there by herself and I instantly feel bad like I'm such like a like I don't want to say I'm like the nicest  person in the world cuz I'm not because I have an attitude and I could totally be a [ __ ] when I need to be but I feel bad for people like that because there  was a point in my life where I had zero friends like when I was a freshman in high school no friends at a big school  like my first time being at this high school was big like , students school not knowing anybody like I know  that feeling of being by yourself and I don't like people to feel like that so I invited me to come with my girls like yeah she's a stranger but like I've met  a lot of other cool people there so I wasn't really like pressed about like oh my god she's like gonna do something to us like she's like a regular looking  like  year old girl so you guys are gonna call me a [ __ ] cheese head or like a head ass person for this but my friends ended up deciding that they  wanted to go smoke and this was a time where I was like super super against it like I don't even remember why I was  super against it like now like I don't care if my friends smoke around me but I was super against like being like around  them cuz I didn't want to get like secondhand smoke or whatever like [ __ ] like shut up I ended up separating myself from my friends and me and  Chelsea went down to this like sandwich shop I don't remember what it's called but this place will you put like cereal  in your sandwiches like bacon literally anything in there and a lot of the things they're like labeled is like weed related like names and stuff I  can't remember its speak Vanessa I can't remember what it's called so if somebody like knows like it's by first Friday  it's like a sandwich shop but you could get like cereal you can get like all these like crazy things and they're like  they're called like nug or like an ounce sandwich like stuff like that so is it like weird how I left my friends who  were smoking to go to a shop that's like I mean this girl ended up going to like go get sandwiches or whatever because  like I said my friends were smoking and I didn't want to like be in the car while they were hotboxing and I also didn't want to just like stand outside  the car cuz that's like weird and it was kind of like gross outside so I'd rather be in the a/c so while I met this hand was shop with Chelsea I always do this  every time I meet someone new and like let's play sweaty mind clash it was like let me like ask you all these things about yourself so I could see if like  we're actually gonna like be friends or if there's any potential there cuz I don't want to be friends with people that like we have no similar interest  you know cuz like believe it or not when people say opposites attract no they don't try again I have tried to be friends  with people that were complete opposite than me and that did not work at all I tried to date a guy the last guy that I dated the one that I met that first  Friday as well we were complete opposites and it worked for like four months but it got to the point of like bro we're way too different than like  this is not gonna go anywhere so that's why it like but anyway so I'm asking Chelsea all these questions and she's  telling me she doesn't have any siblings she only has a mother she doesn't have her father all this stuff keep in mind  I'm mentioning this because I found out later on this girl has like two brothers three sisters she has a dad like her dad  is completely in her life he actually is like funding everything because this girl doesn't have an actual job I found out she did tell me that like she was  like doing like little things online or whatever that she was trying to be an influencer but if you have like , followers I don't think you're living  off of that so I did a fighting up at this girl if her dad was like sending her money so she could survive and stuff but like I'm not like judging that like  I really don't care that's not my situation I wish I had a dad that could send me [ __ ] like $, I wish I  could have a dad that would give me  K and months to live and like you don't have to do anything but obviously like that's not really like smart on the  parents side cuz like it's not really doing anything it what happens when you stop giving them money then they don't know what to do I think that I noticed  that was red flag for me was every single time that I would like say like oh I really enjoy doing this or I really enjoy doing  this she would go on like a five-minute tangent about that exact same topic telling me how much she likes it and how  much she's into that as well so at the time I didn't know what she was doing that just to be like oh yeah I like that too I like that too so we could like  relate on everything or if we actually did relate on everything because this girl like I said she went on like a good like five minutes Anjan about every  little thing like oh yeah I enjoy doing YouTube dude I love doing YouTube too so here's my whole YouTube story like  literally she would go off a pump everything and I mean I love to talk so it was nice to just like be quiet and  listen to someone else for once but like this girl went on so me and this girl we're sitting there for like  or  minutes I'm literally like texting my  friends like hello like are you guys done are you done I walked back to their car with her and they're literally just like sitting there laughing I'm like  like Hello like you guys kind of like abandoned me oh I want you guys to remember that I  have only known this girl for about an hour right so when we go back to my friends and my friends was okay like we're gonna go like go back out there  we're gonna start hanging out and stuff she instantly for some reason like switched her demeanor and she started to act annoyed and she was like you know  what I'm actually just gonna like go home like here's my number just like text me and we can hang out or whatever and I got weirded out cuz I was like why  does she just like like her demeanor by changing I mean like when she saw my friends and she saw that like like I  don't know like it was just like weird like she just all of a sudden switched like you know like I don't know how to explain it like that one friend who gets  jealous when you hang out with other friends because they're like no I want you to myself like that kind of person but keep in mind egg donor for an hour  but she was acting like that and it was kind of like weird so she was like oh I'm gonna dip or whatever like we  already added each other on snapchat I do not give my phone number away right away because you never know who you are  talking to like this is a lesson for you guys if you are like meeting people for the first time do not give them your phone number right away cuz you do not  understand the power behind a phone number you can like type in a phone number online pay a dollar  to find  out where that person lives their criminal history all like their family members everything so do not just give  your number out to random people give them your snapchat and make sure you have your geolocation turned off just in  case you never know we only stay there for maybe like  minutes more my friend Jobs but my house and literally the second I  step into my door this girl text is me and she's like I had a great time tonight like you're such a cool vibe whatever like I would love to like hang  out again and of course like I had a good time too if they're like obviously I did pick up on the whole like Yes Man  thing but like some people do that when they meet people for the first time so it wasn't like a big deal to me so we  ended up making plans to like go and hang out and like go get Starbucks or something like the next day because I mean I have the time and I guess she did  too so the next day comes and she asks me if she could come over to my house and obviously I wasn't comfortable with that because I've had experiences with  like weird people so like I'm not gonna just I don't care if you're a girl she's like I'm not gonna do anything like you think I'm a crazy person or something  like girl I have known you for about a day like I'm not gonna just let you come to my house they ended up meeting halfway because she looked like all the  way like downtown Phoenix and I live more towards going like by Nevada am i sweating so I live like more up like  going towards Nevada and she looks more like downtown so like we're about like an hour away so like I said we ended up just like meeting halfway up like in  random Starbucks just we gonna get coffee I'm like talk and get to know each other a little bit more because I mean I didn't really know what else we  were gonna do everything went fine like literally no issues like I can't even like say like there was a problem she  was acting weird like everything was normal like no problems at all I really was like starting to like I was like  this Chelsea girl's kind of cool like we actually relate on a lot of the same stuff like the exact same things but  like I said she could have just been a yes-man but like when she was going on these tangents about how much she liked  each of these things it made me feel like oh she's actually like into it because I was slowly like not really being friends with somebody another  influencer like this is no shade or anything we just kind of like grew apart like when people aren't really like on  the same page about certain things and you guys aren't into the same stuff you just grow apart so me and this girl  started hanging out like I said almost every other day if not every single day so we're gonna go ahead and fast-forward  to the first incident of this girl showing that she is a complete psychopath so the first week of September and it applying to LA and I  had this plan of just staying there for like a week or whatever just to like hang out with my friends you know see what's going on because honestly Arizona  does get kind of dry and boring some time like right now it's like cool or whatever cuz like I've been like chillin with all my friends and stuff but at the  time I was feeling very demi lovato lonely so I ended up hitting up my ex boyfriend and I was like you should let me like  interview you for like a video like this could be like some cool content so he ended up coming over Denzel interviewed  us acts just like random questions so I end up finishing the video I posted the snapchat like you guys like you're not gonna believe like who I'm here with  right now like you guys are gonna have no like ideal like you're gonna be shook when you see this there's no texting me like dude who is it who is it who is it  like who like who isn't it so keep in mind Chelsea has no idea that like I was filming this video with my ex-boyfriend  because I didn't really tell her about it because it was very on the spot like oh like [ __ ] it like let's film this video so she ends up responding to my  snapchat story saying like oh dude who is it who was it you never told me about this I'm like oh it's like it's Jan is my ex-boyfriend like it was a guy like I  interviewed him for a video and literally like I just saw her character like her little bit moment you just go like she was like typing and everything  I Billy didn't just boom so I like sound like question mark like what happened and she was like K and like swiped out  of it okay I really don't understand the  issue like why are you mad that I'm filming a video with my ex-boyfriend like I don't see any like problem with  that plus you don't know him so it's like why are you upset about anything so I literally like let it go I really did  not care like I am in such a chill mood you guys like I don't know what happened to me in like the past year but I am in  such honestly after that Carl situation I don't care about anything anymore like I'm very just like no drama keep it to  yourself I don't want to hear about that like I don't want to deal with it I'm trying to relax like my blood pressure is getting  too high like I got time for this so like I said I let that [ __ ] go and I did not care but I also didn't hear from her  for like  days until she like randomly hit me up again keep in mind I was trying to reach out to her but she would literally like not even open my messages  not left on rent she wouldn't even open up the Samantha just our messages or anything so finally after three days I  sent her something again and I'm like yo like is there actually a problem because I'm confused and she proceeded to like  go off on me and tell me like I don't know why like you're associating with this guy that hurts you you told me that he hurts you that he did all these  things to you like why are you associating with him like why are you putting yourself in that position to get hurt again and literally I'm just  sitting here like looking at my phone as she's typing all these things on I'm like like what are you talking about I'm literally having  Denzel interview us for content on my channel I'm not trying to fall back in his lap and like oh my god let's be in  love again like no you're my ex I don't ex not going back I'm good like we  literally filmed a video so I was confused as to why she was like going off on me as if like she was like my  best friend for years that I've been like crying it to her about or something like I told her a very short summary of like our relationship because we were  talking about boyfriends one day I did not like well he ruined my life or something cuz he didn't like it wasn't  that deep for her to go off on me like that for no reason but I literally remember responding like you need a chill out and just like closing the  thing and not going back in there for another day cuz I'm like what the [ __ ] is wrong with this girl like I said I did not speak to this girl  for like another day and she ends up hitting me up again saying so where was he staying what do you mean where was he  staying she was like oh is he staying in your hotel room with you like [ __ ] what  the [ __ ] are you going on if I was like what like what how does that concern you - I don't know where he is and three  like why does that matter why is this the first thing that you're hitting me up saying talking about where is he is he staying with you at your hotel and  she's like oh I'm just like making sure that you're not doing anything dumb or making mistakes girl at the time I was   so I was like girl I'm  years old why are you trying to like run my life we've known each other for about a month  what is going on right now which is like oh sorry I'm not going to be pushy I just care a lot for my friends and I don't want to see them make mistakes  like okay and if I'm gonna make a mistake let me but like I'm not like I know what I'm doing and now I was  actually starting to get annoyed so I told her I said girl it's not that deep I don't want to argue about something  that is literally pointless especially since we just became friends like I really don't want to do this right now  so like can we drop this and move on and she's like fine I agree like we'll let it go it's whatever so after that  incident everything went back to normal when I got back home we started hanging out again and everything was like good to go no issues so now we're gonna fast  forward towards the end of October when I started seeing my boyfriend so ex-boyfriend by seeing I mean like we  were going on dates all the time like we're in a little like honeymoon phase of like wanting to like always go here and do this and like let's go hiking  here let's go do this like basically being all over the place and being all over each other basically and once again  prai's chose to catch an issue because I wasn't hanging out with her every other day or every single day now she had a  problem and she literally went off on me she was like dude like I don't know what's going on like we're supposed to be best friends and you're putting this  guy before I mean you're putting him above me like this is not like okay like friends don't treat each other like that going on this whole tangent about  nothing first of all sis we've known each other for about eight months now so you're gonna have to go ahead and like  sit down and relax and stop acting like we've been together for years and I just like threw you a trash can or something  and I'm not talking to you I'm literally seen you still like twice or three times a week I just want to also see the guy  that I'm interested in you know so she ends up proceeding to tell me like oh dude you don't understand you don't get it like you don't know where I'm coming  from and she just cut the conversation there and that was done I did not talk through this girl for maybe a week or a week and a half after this because I  genuinely got creeped out because I was like dude like I have like has like friends like I'm not gonna like saying  her name but I had a friend in the past when I was living in LA we were only friends for a couple of months if this girl I kid you not we just show up  places like me and my friends would be out to dinner and show buddy dude they come down the street you know like how how do you even know where we are  she would not be invited to places and she would still show up so now like I  don't know there are some people in this world that like once they become your friend they think that you guys have to be attached to the hip and clearly this  is what Chelsea thought so like I said I haven't seen this go for about a week and a half she reaches out to me again and she tells me to meet her at Bobby Q  which is a barbecue restaurant like more towards like the Phoenix area and I mean honestly I was just like hungry in the  moment so I was like okay like let me go entertain her and see what she has to say she turned it into a big-ass deal  once it again like oh you're neglecting me like you're not being like the best friend that you're supposed to be and  I'm literally like trying to process like how does this girl not realize that we've only known each other for about a  month and like she's acting like I need to be attached to her hip at all times like I have never experienced someone  like that before so I'm like genuinely confused as to like why this is such a  serious big deal but like I understand some people take things a lot deeper so I listen to her I heard her out we ended  up eating or whatever we went to Fashion sway I walked around a little bit that we went separate ways so I thought everything was sign again it wasn't not my nd  birthday is coming up and she's asking me if I want to make any plans for it so I'm gonna do like a party or whatever but honestly you guys like I am over  birthdays like I really don't care I'm after I made  it doesn't matter until I turn  and  then  and then  and the  so like I don't even care about my birthday until I turn  well I told her I was like  dude like I really don't care to like do anything big I'm probably just gonna go and spend time with my family because I haven't been spending that much time  with them at the moment so I was like I'm just gonna go with them and they're probably gonna do like cake or whatever she's like oh can I come along whatever  and I'm like oh like it's just gonna be like me and my family and she got upset let me tell you what happened the day  after my birthday that genuinely pissed me off because this guy is so nice and he was like like he's not rich or  whatever so I'm not expecting like a guy that I'm dating to go and buy me like all of his jewelry and all this nice stuff especially since we're just dating  and we're not in like an official relationship yet so the fact that he even got me something in general for my birthday it was like meaningful and was  like special to me so I always wear bandanas so we ended up getting me all these different kinds of bandanas that I  didn't have already then I was also talking to him about like my interest in art and how I like to draw so we ended  up getting me in an art set as well like I know those are like like little things but that means he was paying attention  to what I was saying and actually like got me something that I was interested in and like would be useful for me so I  was extremely flattered I was so happy because every guy that I've ever dated has never gotten me anything on  Valentine's Day never got me birthday presents like literally nothing so I was like wow this is the first time a guy just like a nice gesture I don't care if  it's not like a [ __ ] ring or like a bracelet or something like I wasn't expecting anything in general I'm over  here like oh my gosh look this is so cute so I get my phone into Michael hook Chelsea like look what he got me and guess who had a problem Chelsea I don't  know what she said this [ __ ] said you didn't tell me that she wanted a gift I would have gotten you something better  than that whack-ass [ __ ] that he just got you first of all [ __ ] I'm happy  with what I got he literally did not have to get me anything but he still chose to like I  didn't ask for anything for my birthday I'm turning  years old if you're still expecting gifts at  you need to grow  up and go get your own [ __ ] so I'm not expecting any thing like I said and the fact that he got me something and that she wants to  shut it down to be like oh that wack ass [ __ ] that he bought you I would've got you something better that was not okay  to me and I genuinely got mad and I told her off that day when I tell you I had to delete snapchat off my phone like I  could have just logged out but I literally deleted the app out of frustration because the amount of times maybe maybe maybe maybe she kept calling  me for a solid hour until like I got to the point of deleting the [ __ ] I was  so annoyed and stressed on like it's literally like the day after my birthday I should be happy and like oh my friend Bailey know this girl ruined everything  it just like pissed me off but I ended up going and hanging out with my boo at the time so like everything was fine it was fine chance of snap facetiming me  the next day saying like oh dude like I'm so sorry like I didn't mean to blow up on you like that I was just like it's whatever it's whatever like I don't care  but keep in mind I'm remembering all this like this is the third time in a few months that you have blown up on me  over something so minimal and got so upset with me over nothing and just being rude for no reason so like I'm not  gonna forget that when that moment I decided I'm gonna slowly start to like distance myself from this girl like I'm not just gonna cut her off randomly cuz  I feel like she might like do something crazy cuz of I mean how she's been acting in the past that was like my idea  in my head like I'm just gonna slowly like distance myself from jealousy but for like the next like week or two we didn't see each other we just like you  know talked through like snapchat or whatever just like oh this is what I'm doing today like she would try to like make plans but like I said I wasn't  really like filming it at the moment because I was like genuinely kind of like pissed off with her now we're in December and I ended up going to LA for  like two weeks I was staying with Steven at the time and I could see that this girl was like still viewing all of my stories still like watching everything  that I was doing but she wasn't in contact with me at all for these two weeks that I went to LA she would not  snap me she wouldn't talk to me I mean I wasn't reaching out either so like I know the phone goes both ways but like I wasn't reaching out and she wasn't  reaching out to me probably I'm going to assume because she saw me hanging out with other people and it made her mad again so now we're at the part where  Chelsea officially gets the boot because she showed her like true crazy like I genuinely do not understand how the   year old acts like this so because me and the boy that I was seeing ended up making it official I decided to get him  so thank you for Christmas so I always wear this like I don't have it on right but I always would wear this like light symbol it was like a cute or hi McGraw  you look Tyra graphite I don't know how to pronounce it Siri what was the name of the symbols  that Egyptians used hieroglyphics always  very simple that like had that thing on it so I wanted to get him like a little one too because it represents life and I  don't know I just thought that was like sweet so I got for him I focus in that same day that we ended up like giving each other stuff Chelsey hits me up and  she's like hey like I know you're back in town can I give you your Christmas gift like send me your address and I'm gonna come and drop it off I'm sorry but  like Chelsey you scare me so I'm not gonna give you my address and let you just pull up on me at any moment because  it may be an innocent I'm just gonna drop a gift off right now but what if we stop being friends or what if you get  mad again are you just gonna show up to my door like I I'm good on that I've just had an experience with that crazy  boy and that boy would show up to my house leaving flowers tying things to my door taping notes to my garage I think I  learned my lesson and I'm not gonna give you my address Chelsey but keep fighting back with her and I'm literally saying like no let's meet at whiskey and she's  like no I'm gonna bring it to your house no let's meet at Fashion Square no Vanessa I want to come to your house and bring it and I'm like dude no I will  meet you in public to get and she's like why won't you give me your address and I'm like it doesn't matter why I will give it to you like let's just meet in  public and like I was gonna go and like buy her some like [ __ ] like gift or something for like bath and Bodyworks that's a park way place by the whiskey  I'm just gonna go and pull some [ __ ] and just give it to her because I felt bad this girl keeps freaking buying me things and I'm not giving her anything  back so I was like let me just go get her like a fragrance or something and like call it a day but she was so persistent and like asking me like give  me your address Vanessa like why are you being weird about it and I was like I'm not being weird I would just rather just meet you in public and not like do this  at my house and she's like do what do it at your house what are we doing and I'm like like nothing like just exchanging  gifts like this [ __ ] gets my gift goes outside and proceeds to smash it with a  [ __ ] bat and send me a video [ __ ] I'm literally look I'm literally  looking at my phone like she sent me a  video of her destroying my Christmas gift because I wouldn't let her drop it off at my house and that was the final  straw cuz this [ __ ] is clearly showing violent tendencies and I'm not trying to get in a fight so after she sent me that  I would really said yeah I'm done with you and I unfriended her on snapchat I said yeah I'm never talking to that girl again like no remove her off of  Instagram unfollowed her on Twitter I don't even know why follow her on Twitter in the first place but she was like please follow me on Twitter like I  don't even use Twitter so I go on everything that I had here added on removed deleted everything blocked [ __ ]  you're gone and this is when things started to get very very creepy this girl started to reach out to Steven she  tried to talk to my mom my mom has a private Instagram account so she doesn't get like the messages and stuff she gets  message requests and this girl was literally like hey can you give me Vanessa's number and my mom's like who  is this girl asking me for your phone number like is this like a subscriber or something and I was like no like that's  Chelsea the Chelsea I was telling you about like I said she started reaching out to Steven as well and this is when me and Steven are like really trying to  like rebuild our friendship and stuff from the past like yeah we were still like friends and like talking and stuff but like we were really trying to like rebuild it so the fact that she's  already bringing drama to him and he's I don't want to look messy like [ __ ] I was so messy in the past and I'm trying  to like have a mature adult relationship and friendship with these people now so the fact that she was already like  breeding all this [ __ ] it's like it's gonna make me look bad but Steven already knew everything about Chelsea so it was very simple for him to literally  just like Blocher like he showed me everything but he blocked it right after and I was like don't respond to her if she tries to add you on snapchat or  anywhere else do not talk to this girl like I don't know why she's so adamant on trying to find my address and trying to get to me  one of the main reasons why I started dating my boyfriend is because he's somebody that doesn't really [ __ ] with  social media he doesn't use Instagram like that he's not on Twitter he's not on like you two been doing all this  stuff like he doesn't really like he doesn't even really even use snapchat which I know to some people that may seem like kind of sauce like oh but does  he really not use it like he probably has a secret account no like this was I think like one of the reasons why I  didn't work out behind or with us was because he was kind of like boring and he was kind of like I don't know like he  wasn't the typical like  year old guy he was more of like a  year old you're  the great guy don't get me wrong like super nice sweet everything but he was kind of like boring and like not really  with the shit's if that makes sense like he was like something that didn't really get it if that makes sense but like I like that about him I like  that he wasn't all about social media and trying to be a [ __ ] SoundCloud rapper and like doing all that like when I said that he doesn't use Instagram  much he does have an account but he has like four photos on there from the past like five years so he's not somebody  that's constantly on there checking his Instagram and stuff like none of that he calls me one day and he says Vanessa why  is Chelsea DM in me and literally in that moment I like froze and I was like  what the actual this girl with DM to me asking me like where's Vanessa at is she  okay like I need to be in contact with her like do you have her address I know you're her boyfriend like you send me her number  now she's reaching out to my boyfriend and very scarily things went quiet with  Chelsea I didn't hear back from this girl for like several weeks did not hear anything a nut back from her but like I  haven't heard anything from her no DMS no anything I was actually starting to watch my DMS closely and  actually watching who's looking at my stories who's viewing like everything like just trying to see if like maybe she made like another username that  might look like her like I'm searching on snapchat like Chelsea like trying to see if anybody like that's related to  her name like she may have gone silent but I know that she was watching me from another account because you know when you go on Instagram you tap on like your  username if you have like a spam or whatever you could just like login directly to it like just like tap on that name and it takes you to that  account when she tapped on it one day [ __ ] mm-hm list so I know this girl has like  several accounts that she like watches her old friends off of and like goes in  like looks at people from her past and stops them basically because there were several times where we would just be chilling like doing nothing and she'd be  like oh I just like accidentally texted blah blah blah and I'm like how do you accidentally text somebody that doesn't  like you and hasn't wanted anything to do with you for the past year oh my gosh look what they posted on their story and  I'm like didn't they block you and she's like dude I have another account like that's like like it's funny and like I  probably laughed in the moment but like now that I look back at it it's kind of creepy you know cause it's like why are  you keeping up with all these people that don't want anything to do with you so that's how I know that this girl was probably watching me on one of her like  little fake accounts or whatever like I said I didn't hear from this girl for weeks so now we are into February and  things we're starting to not really like work out with me and my boyfriend like I said opposites do not attract all the time like sometimes it may work and like  a rare instance but like with us like we were way too opposite I'm very like loud out there and like he was very like  quiet and like chill and just like it just wasn't gonna work we ended up splitting up and we're still friends  like we still like hit each other up maybe like once a week just like how are you how's your week been mental health like all that like just chill like we're  friends because everything ended like on a good note like we didn't end like oh my gosh we hate each other like we were  fighting cuz we never did so like everything was just like chill so of course he was gonna call me when Chelsea walked into his work yeah  keep in mind I met him originally because he worked at a place that was at First Friday so I don't know if maybe she like somehow like I don't know like  I didn't tell her where he works yes she knew what he looked like because we were friends that I showed her like this is me and him or whatever and I've  obviously taken pictures with him didn't post them but like we take a lot of Polaroid so I would have him around my house and stuff so she knew what he  looked like but I never told her where he worked I told her that me and him also met at First Friday one day like  randomly because he was on his job and I saw him and I was like oh but like I said I did not tell this girl where he  worked I did tell her that he worked right next to the street by first Friday so I don't know if this girl was going into several businesses looking for him  but clearly she was because she showed about his job this guy works in a restaurant so he's over here like doing his thing he sees her walk in and  immediately calls me and is like yo like this girl is in here like whoa like the crazy girl Chelsea like she's in here  she's in my work so while he was on the phone with me I actually heard like somebody in the background be like bro why are you on your phone get back out  there so he answers like going back out there and they said no like I'll call you after work he calls me after work and tells me that  Chelsea went straight up to him and continuously kept flirting with him like oh you're so fine like you're so hot  like are you single like girl you know that this was my boyfriend like she doesn't know that we broke up  and she wouldn't try to flirt with him like you should let me get your number like let me like let's do drinks after like you're off or something like girl  but literally telling this girl through voice memo reach out again [ __ ] and I'm gonna go to the cops and tell them that  you're stopping me and that's not gonna look cute on your record girl ends up reading the message doesn't respond to  me at all uh nads me as a friend on snapchat and that's that I haven't heard from her since understand how people can get so  attached as a friend like that I don't know what she went through in her past that made her this way  like I join you don't understand how she ended up this way like she would not share super personal details like  remember when I told you that she said she didn't have a dad but her dad's been like sending her money in this whole time she has no siblings only child but  she has all these brothers and sisters like I don't know why she lied about details like that to try to make herself seem like oh it's just me and my mom  like I don't know why she came up with this whole story so I don't really know what she went through as a kid because  yeah she would like tell me things about her but like she never like told me super super deep stuff and I didn't tell  her super deep stuff either because guess when I learned my lesson I really don't know what she went there like she definitely told me about like the holy  drugs and like all that stuff and like the drinking and stuff like we've talked about that but like she hasn't told me  anything else there's obviously a reason why she told me that she didn't have a dad there's a reason she said that she  had no siblings so like I don't know what that is and I really don't care to figure it out either that is a story of my psycho ex best friend I don't  consider her my best friend but she considered me her best friend so I guess we were best friends I don't know I'm just not gonna even try  anymore like imma stick with my dude friends and like my two girlfriends that I have and just like stick with that  like I'm not trying anymore they gets to a point where like I'm just like super discouraged and I don't like I got trust  issues now because of all these like situations that I'm going through and that's not something cute to admit like I'm not like I can't see she's like  that's not cute like no again I have a struggle with making relationships with people and forming relationships and  keeping them because of these trust issues that I have this was just another episode of like stupid crazy [ __ ] that  happened in my life so I'm just gonna keep to myself no new friends I'm good hey not [ __ ] is not  and not fun was it for this story I hope you guys enjoyed it do you have anybody in your life that's similar to this and  if you do you should probably turn around and run learn from my example I don't know why I look past red flags and  why I try to seek friendship and people but honestly I think it's because I was really lonely in the moment and I just  like I said I stopped hanging out with like one of my like best friends and I kind of wanted to like find somebody  else to like hang out with and like fill up that gap and I filled it up with the wrong person so yeah that's it for this  video let me know in the comments below if you've ever dealt with somebody like this in your life before and I will see you guys all in my next video bye
