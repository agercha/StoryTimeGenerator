Wait wait wait wait! Before you unsubscribe. (laughing) I'm dyeing it back in two weeks, okay?  I feel like before I even get into the video I have to address the fact that I have pink hair  I don't know, I've always, always wanted pink hair. Like, my entire life, I've wanted to just do it  once, I wanted to just say "fuck it". I don't want it to be any other hair color, because I know it's not going to look good.  Blonde me is a thing. I look like Michael Jackson with any other hair color.  It's like, holiday break right now. I have to grow out my hair anyways 'cause of my scalp — just Tana things, Tana problems.  I can't bleach my scalp until January, right before I go on tour, so I've been having to grow out my roots, and I was like, "you know what while I have roots and while I'm not doing anything to my hair, I'm just going to say fuck it, and I'm going to dye it pink." So I took my happy ass to Hot Topic today.  -laughing-  and I bought some pink hair dye and now  my hair is pink. I did it myself  also to my hairdresser you don't know this is  happening. You might be watching this I'm  really sorry. I just know  she is mad. She is going to deck me in the fucking face.  Next time she see me. She always tells me to  never do anything to my hair. But yeah, it's semi-permanent  and as soon as I go back blonde for  tour, like, in a month or so I'll be  blonde again. So I thought for a month  I would have pink hair, and I'm not going to lie I  really fucking like it. And I'm  really really really proud of myself  for doing something I said I was never  going to do. Jumping out of my fucking  ultimate comfort zone.  My ultimate comfort zone is my blonde hair.  I'm not even kidding you. That's the one thing  that I, like, consider my comfort zone. So the fact that  I have pink hair and I dig it is really  fucking cool. Wise words of my mother  who actually gave birth to me, I actually came out of her  pussy, Jenna Marbles, "life is  way too fucking short not to have fun  ass hair", so here I am, with  fun, pink hair! If you're gonna unsubscribe  'cause my hair's not blonde anymore, just wait a month  just  days, like, whatever, like, like me for my  personality. Go look at my old videos.  Like, if you're a guy and you're new here, like, and you'd  pipe blonde me, just, like, go watch those videos.  Wait a month, okay? So now [laughs]. Hi guys, it's  Tana Mongeau, and I don't know if you guys  know this — if you know me, you know this —  I fly so much.  I just got back from the airport, probably, like,   hours ago, and I'm leaving for the airport  again in, like,  hours. I'm always working  I'm always travelling to Los Angeles  I'm always fucking on a plane, going somewhere.  Like, I literally need my own plane.  If there are any sugar daddies out there and you just, like, wanna buy me a plane, like,  my business email's below.  [laughs] I'm just kidding.    But really, I'm always flying on planes, and  I wanted to do this for a while. And if you guys have been here  since, like, the beginning, I used to do this series  a little more, where I would make a video  and I would have a bunch of mini storytimes  all in one — like, I'm just telling you, like  four or five stories in one video  or, like, three or four, whatever.  And today I thought it would be really fun  to tell you guys some of my bad flight slash  bad airport experiences, all compiled into   video. So that's what I'm going to do  today. I'm going to tell you guys some  bad airport, bad flight attendant, bad  plane experience storytimes, and I have  some great ones for you.  So yeah! Before I get into this video, if  you have not subscribed, I mean, like, tits,  a story, like, I talk, like, I'm kinda funny,  like, maybe you could do it, like, I  normally I have blonde hair and I'm, like,  fuckable, like, it's, like, a thing, like, you  know? Subscribe! I'm just kidding.  But really yeah, if you haven't subscribed  you should subscribe. And if you have subscribed, you  should follow all my social media below  especially my snapchat and my Instagram  because we're close to a million. It  would be fun. Okay. I'm gonna shut up now.  I'm sorry for all of the shameless promo  and pink hair and whatever the fuck else  I'm talking about. Hi. I love you.  Let's get into the stories. I've never  flown Spirit Airlines. I'm not a fan of  Spirit Airlines I feel like it's in the  same classification as Allegiant and  Allegiant is by far my least favorite  airline I don't know if you follow me on  twitter it's all I fucking tweet about  for like a month on tour my entire to  over the last two months every single  stop I told the story about how much I  hate Allegiant airlines, had a bad  experience on Allegiant airlines, I'll  eventually tell that story on camera for  anybody who didn't go to my tour shows  but I just fucking hate Allegiant Airlines  It is literally the fucking scum of airlines  and spirit airlines is like right there  with Allegiant. Really really cheap  flight prices but everything else  fucking sucks so that they can  compromise for their cheap flight prices  if that makes sense. And something that I just  found out about Spirit Airlines is that  the times that they tell you their  flights are going to take off at, like  let's say you buy a flight for like  a.m whatever,  Spirit puts in their fine print  that "those times are only a suggestion"  A SUGGESTION  A SUGGESTION!  I don't know if you get what  that means but like basically like every  other line like when they say a time  they mean it like Spirit puts that in  their fine print so then when you check  their like, I agree box, you're agreeing  to the fact that you can buy a flight  for  a.m. and it can leave at pm for  no reason and you can't get a refund, you  can't get on a later flight, you can't  complain,  nothing, because the time that they told  you they were just suggesting that the  plane MIGHT leave at that time like  that's how shitty of an airline Spirit  airlines is and that's why I never flew it.  But one day I was in Los Angeles and I had  to fly home the next day for a hair  appointment. I'm so sorry to my hair lady  again if you're still watching this, she's  probably just watching this like, in  fucking awe of how much of a dumb bitch I am  but like, whatever. I needed to fly on super  early i'm talking like -am early so  that i could be at my am hair  appointment the next day and no other  airlines had flights early enough so I  booked a flight with spirit airlines and  the suggested time was am so i get to  LAX falling asleep in the fucking chair  i get on the plane and they don't have  like first-class it's all just like one  plane of like the most smushed together  seats you'll ever see  it's like three tiny assets like no  armrests nothing all smushed together in  a row so i went ahead and got the very  first seats on the road because they  have like the big seat as the very first  row instead of three seats must enroll  it's only to sow the seeds like normal  size it's a little bigger  it reclines a little bit more it's just  like one tiny baby step up from like  their shitty seats  I wouldn't even call it a step I'm  calling a tow I got those seats though  so I was sitting in the very front row  and so now we get into the story time I  just want to give you guys a little  consensus so as I'm boarding the plane  the flight attendant always stands at  the very beginning of the plane to like  greet you before you sit down so it's   a.m. and the Sun hasn't even began  to like rise  I am fucking exhausted like don't speak  to me  don't look at me don't read this thing  areas we don't fucking cough around me  give you a baby fucking choke it i don't  want to be looked at like that's how  fucking tired IM and so I'm walking out  of the plane I'm like my eyes are like  closed and all of a sudden I hear good  morning welcome to spirit airlines and  I'm just like it's five thirty five in  the morning like you're really that  fucking happy to be here and doing your  job and i know i'm sitting here  criticizing like how happy someone is  but like fuck bitch where like are you on coke are you on speed or are you on  adderall, are you on redbull like how are you that  like fuck hi I love my job  and you work for spirit airline and i was like why  are you that happy and so I say nothing to her  because I would just like like I nodded  my head I tried to open my eyes I tried  to be respectful but that's all i could  muster and so as I'm walking away  I hear you're not going to say  goodmorning back literally like back  like are you a mess like where is your  crack spoon holy fuck, so i turn around and  I'm like good morning  and then I'm walking my feet and she's  like that's better  and I'm like gonna be a long fly so I  sit down in my seat the rest of the  plane boards as the plane is boarding  she's walking up and down the aisles  just monitoring things that people are  doing she was absolutely one hundred  percent one of those people that are  just so obsessed with doing their job  perfectly and so obsessed with like  being meticulous and like anal and my  crazy like she literally masturbates  that night to like how she can be a  better flight attendant and I'm like  those people I get it you're an  overachiever like that's amazing but  fuck like it's a  in the morning you work  with spirit airlines like why do you  care this much i feel like if i worked for  spirit airlines and it was  in the  morning I'll be like just crashed the  fucking plane like and I jumped out like  i don't i didn't get the mindset  she's walking up and down the aisles  opening the overhead compartments like  turning people's luggage like a  -degree angle so that it's like in the  overhead compartment perfectly like  walking up to people and taking their  headphones out of their ears so that  they are prepared to listen to the  safety announcement getting in people's  personal fucking space to take the  safety booklet out turn it around so  it's like facing the right way like in  the seatback pocket walking up to people  and like forcing them to chug their  drinks so that like they don't spill  while taking off and like that's not  even a rule like you're allowed to have  drinks while taking out like what the  fuck she wants them to this kid with a  skateboard and is like so I see you have  a skateboard  i need like yeah and she's like rule   of spirit airlines prohibit skateboards  being actively open on a plane you're  going to put in your carry-on go ahead  and go outside the death can check it  and he's like security let me take it  like this it's all I have  I don't have a carry-on or checked bag  actually looks at me like well then you  can't fly  can you and then he kept trying to talk  me like it's literally all I have like  i'll put in the overhead compartment  like although check and just let it like  rollout of the security that's what you  want as she keeps interrupting him being like a rule   prohibit   prohibits spirit airlines rule   prohibits that you take a skateboard  openly on the plane and literally made  this human being  get off of the plane and not fly so  finally she resumed her little position  in the front of the plane prepared to  give the safety announcement is  literally standing there waiting for the  safety announcement like shit to come on  and she's standing like this like posing  for the fucking announcement at five  thirty in the morning like are you  sane like where is your fucking  sanity like this is all she had  ok one hundred percent of the CEO spirit  airlines would fucking come at this  bitch because like she literally was  like a robot so right before she's  about to do a little announcement like  she's literally standing there like this  she looks at me because i'm sitting in  the seat right in front of her because I  mean like the front row seat i'm sitting  there on my phone because you don't have  the fucking put your phone on airplane  mode until the plane is like taking off  and like im a fucking rebel and I  never put my phone on airplane mode I just let  myself lose service i text all the way  till i have no service  I've always done it i like answer calls  that as the place like landing I don't  probably gonna die early anyway so I'm  not here like actively trying to like to  save my life by putting it on airplane  mode and like honestly if a fucking  plane that can propel itself like in the  air is going to crash because my phone  isn't on airplane mode let it burn  let's go im ready so sitting on my phone  texting and I'm texting my hair  lady like what time im going to land like  something it was something like decent  important and those things are  looking at my phone and all of a sudden  I feel fucking mrs. spirit cock in her  mouth  this close to my face I'm sitting there  on my phone and I just feel my phone  leaving my hands don't touch my fucking  phone I will slit your fucking throat  that giant that people I'm like one  of the most giant pet fucking Kives of  mine in all of life  don't touch my fucking phone or I will  touch your fucking firstborn child for  the hands with mystical like I hate when  people drive on my manager  Jordan like my best friend my family  he's never touched my phone and like get  angry about that like to visit I hate it  i'm a sauce ass bitch I have a lot of  fucking happiness but really like don't  touch my fucking phone  I will touch your fucking house with  gasoline and a fucking match like a  donut right now and so she grabbed my  phone and I look up and I'm like  literally and she's like I'm sorry I  thought your phone was supposed to be on  airplane mode my dad and I'm like  everybody's just have to put it on your  facebook and fucking slick so really I  was just about to put it on airplane  mode but I'm sorry  and she's like well let's not let this  happen again you wouldn't want to be  stuck in La that's what you look at my  phone like my text messages are like on  my phone like the text i'm typing swipes  up puts it on airplane mode and as  forcefully as humanely possible like  literally like borderline hurt my hand  goes and like slaps it back into my hand  and goes back to her little spirit  airlines fucking position and then she  goes are doing the safety announcement  and the entire time during the safety  announcement if anyone is sleeping stops  the safety on announcement to go wake  them up if anyone has headphones will  walk to the back of the plane stops the  safety announcement takes the headphone  now all of these people that are doing  these things she's warning like if they  do it again they're gonna have to get  off of the flight literally delays the  flight like we're supposed to land at  six-thirty and we landed like   because she kept stopping the safety  announcement to like make sure people  were paying attention so that the plane  takes off and the entire rest of the  flight like waking sleeping people to  ask if they want drinks getting in  people's face like push their carry-ons  further under their seats asking people  to quietly halt their baby from crying  because it is disturbing others i can  you stop your baby we're going without  having like babies but like what are you  doing give it an actually I don't know  plane lands literally is stopping by  everyone  it's like giving their trash being like  make sure to take this off the plane  cycle fucking minutes everyone gets off  she's reading them like to thank you my  spirit airlines they have a spirited day  I get off the plane and I will never  fucking fly suggested time as  crack spoon flight attendants weird  Airlines again and so the last one  happened very recently and this is a  very brief story i talked about on you  now and I think it's not about to stop  my talking on twitter  it was a fucking thing is the first time  I've ever been on a plane and literally  thought I was going to die and i  actually like bought the Wi-Fi in two  minutes to text my mom like I love you  so much i hope nothing happens to me  like that literally like that was how I  was feeling so I'm going out of Italy  Southwest flight love southwest flight  love Southwest Airlines fuckin sponsor  me plz like use cocaine and check out  like five dollars off sponsored so I'm  sitting on this plane and every time  that we take off to Vegas from Southwest  you take off like into the united states  like from California into Nevada why  would you fly the other way like in  devotion like it makes no fucking sense  I've slow this light like a million  times  immediately after sitting down I look  out the window and the plane is not  facing the normal we're in like the  normal place that is normally when I sit  on the plane look out the window like  whatever like I think nothing of it all  is that in the plane takes off and I was  thinking I'm like we were facing like  the ocean what are we going to take off  into the ocean like I don't I don't get  it  and my number-one like fear of dying  other than being burned alive I guess  would be drowning I am terrified of a  plane crashing in the water I'm honestly  not terrified at all really of a plane  like crashing in the ground like burning  because like the second plane crashes  you died upon impact if you don't die  the plane burst into flames and you're  dying like two fucking seconds it's not  really like that miserable of a death  and are really afraid not but I am  terrified of a plane crashing into water  and like you dying from drowning in the  water like that is just so miserable so  terrifying every time I fly over water  on a plane I have to close my eyes are  closed the window like it's something  I'm terrified of it and that definitely  didn't help the situation like in the  slightest so I'm sitting there and we're  flying towards the beach we're passing  the sand for passing the water and all  of a sudden were like over the ocean and  sitting on my fuck literally like the  fuck I am terrify there's no calm like I  was like at this point no one was like  freaking out yet so much all these  people are so fucking probably gonna  fucking die fuck fuck fuck and so then I  by the Wi-Fi I text my mom like I'm  gonna die i fucking love you so much  like i don't know what i was saying like  it was a very french chick moment of  panic and so then we're continuing to  fly deeper and deeper like into the  ocean and then all of a sudden Bolin  once it felt like every single person on  the plane starts also freaking out and  they start screaming getting up out of  their seats like trying to make calls  like freaking the fuck out searching  through their bags for like things like  right on everyone in the plane so it's  freaking out and they all start yelling  the pilot was like what the fuck is  going on boo what the fuck is going on  people are booing which makes no sense  like this isn't a fucking Nickelback  concert like why are you booing like  you're gonna die like the screen like  sheer terror maybe like I don't know  people are going and screaming and then  all of a sudden the pilot comes on  everyone gets quite as fuck they're like  what the fuck is this dumbass  motherfucker is about to kill us going  to say that he literally comes on for  like one second and he's like alright we  will be in Las Vegas and  minutes and  we r  block miles  they're like whatever literally just  announces like how far away we are and  how many miles we are from las vegas &  like the most calm  normal tone and then like goes off and  everyone on the plane loses their  fucking shit people like a running  toward like the pilots cabin people are  booing people screaming because we're  still just flying into the goddamn  Pacific Ocean i'm just sitting there  like this is it like this is how I'm  gonna fucking die like this is it i was  born and died with no errors and so that  as people going crazy the fucking  stewardesses are trying to get people to  sit down there literally screaming in  the stewardess face this way so that all  of a sudden as all of this chaos is  happening the entire plane goes for  coasting into the ocean like this  literally all the way on its side that's  the fastest I've ever moved into playing  the fastest I've ever seen a plane do  that and literally went from like two  flying like honestly like my head was  basically laying on like the window the  plane was like that far on its side that  my head was just like laying on the  window flips a bitch all the way like  that and turns around and straightens  the plane out and then starts flying  back into like the city  everyone is still booing and yelling but  they're like what the fuck is going on  and then the flight attendant comes on  and goes I'm sorry everyone I went the  wrong way  please take your seats and put your seat  belts on we will be in Las Vegas in   minutes and just goes off people on the  plane are crying southwest Wi-Fi sales  went up by like a fucking thousand  they're all buying alive I don't text  their fucking loved ones and shit babies  are just like so many people stuff is  little just like throughout the Isles of  the plane people rocking back and forth  people are breathing in like paper  fucking bags like literally not even  getting it wasn't that bad i'm just  sitting there like numb obvious it in  their BBQ sauce on my titties like and  then literally just slide the entire  life the plane lands  as soon as the plane lands everyone is  standing and booing and yelling like  fuck you don't be fucking die cocksucker  tossing out this fucking idiot pilot he  never came out to know anyone by because  i think people would have literally like  beat his ass and everyone gets off the  black sorry i went the wrong way that  all you're gonna fucking state to a  Southwest fucking flight of like  hundreds of people that were just  bawling their eyes out and screaming and  sheer terror fear for their life
