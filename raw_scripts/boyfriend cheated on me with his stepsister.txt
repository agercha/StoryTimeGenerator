you a bunch of weird it just happens to
1:01
me and because this is like my first
1:03
boyfriend i say that boyfriend very
1:05
loosely
1:06
i was 14 years old i was a freshman in
1:09
high school and this happened which
1:11
almost makes it like worse that this
1:14
happened like it's bad it is just all
1:15
bad all together that this even happened
1:17
to begin with but it is just bad that
1:19
this happened when i was 14 and he was
1:21
14 too so
1:23
and she was 14. all of us were 14 we
1:25
were all freshmen in high school gonna
1:27
give you the whole backstory of how i
1:28
met this person life in high school when
1:30
i was 14 years old okay so let's just
1:32
get in the story so i've mentioned this
1:34
a couple times in other videos but i
1:36
went to an all girls catholic high
1:38
school um and if you know anything about
1:40
that you know somebody that went to an
1:41
all girls catholic high school like you
1:43
know it's not all
1:44
holy up in there so
1:46
because we were all girls we had a
1:48
brother's school the brother school was
1:49
all boys they were like down the street
1:50
from us we had like mixing events and
1:53
stuff like that you had a chance to meet
1:55
people that were guys when we were 14
1:58
and like freshmen and they were like
1:59
mixing us all together doing like the
2:00
freshman mixers it was like feral
2:02
absolutely feral people were getting
2:04
into relationships like the second time
2:06
they met somebody not even the second
2:08
like i remember one time we had we went
2:09
to the fair in our state people were
2:11
like dating by the end of the day i was
2:13
like you guys met 20 minutes ago anyway
2:15
we had all these mixing events so that's
2:18
how i met this person this boy went to
2:19
my brother's school i'm just gonna
2:21
insert a picture in here for context i
2:23
will tell people that i was ugly growing
2:25
up and they're like no you how could you
2:27
be ugly which that's very sweet like
2:29
thank you but a girl was looking like a
2:31
wet bread like i looked so bad i had
2:34
hair up to here had not grown into my
2:36
nose whatsoever i was like extremely
2:40
thin i've always had really big teeth um
2:42
and i had full braces full metal mouth
2:45
going on i had these horrific side bangs
2:48
but that was like that was cool back
2:49
then so i'm not hanging out that much
2:50
but what's wild is during this time when
2:53
i looked like a tiny wet rat i got
2:56
probably more attention from guys than i
3:00
did when i had like my glow up i always
3:02
went to these mixers with the impression
3:04
that nobody was going to even give a
3:06
[ __ ] about me i i kind of was i was
3:08
self-aware that i was ugly because in
3:11
middle school when everybody was getting
3:12
into like their first little like and
3:14
they're both boys relationships that
3:15
were like a bunch of bs i was not
3:17
participating in that i did not get
3:19
picked by any i wanted one i wanted a
3:20
middle school little fling but like
3:22
nobody wanted me because we were in all
3:23
girls high school we didn't have
3:24
football games but most of us would
3:26
attend our brother's school's football
3:28
games they had a really good like
3:29
football team so the games are actually
3:30
pretty fun to go to um that was also an
3:32
opportunity for you to go meet boys and
3:35
i met this boy i thought he was super
3:38
cute this is not this is not the boy
3:39
that i'm gonna be talking about but i'm
3:40
just gonna give the full story i met
3:42
this boy and i thought he was super cute
3:44
and a bunch of the girls at the football
3:46
game were like oh my god he's so cute
3:47
i'm just going to call him i'll call him
3:49
t all the girls at this football game
3:51
were like oh my god he's so cute and i
3:53
was one of them but i was kind of had
3:54
this impression that i was like whatever
3:55
like he's not gonna pick me but i can
3:57
still look i don't know by the grace of
4:00
god why this guy thought i was
4:03
attractive in any shape or form but for
4:05
some reason he liked me i was hyped i
4:07
was so hyped and it was a definite
4:10
confidence booster so this guy doesn't
4:12
know this but like thank you you
4:13
actually like made me feel good about
4:14
myself when i did not feel good about
4:16
myself we like exchanged numbers and
4:18
like snapchats and all that even though
4:20
we were like brother and sister schools
4:22
like we were still separate schools so
4:23
there were separate homecomings and
4:25
there were separate like proms and
4:26
separate dances like separate events
4:28
like that there was kind of an
4:29
opportunity to go to two homecomings
4:30
like you go to your own and then if you
4:32
were invited you could go to your
4:33
brother's schools if somebody brought
4:34
you i was under the impression that like
4:36
this guy i'd been talking to was going
4:38
to take me to his homecoming and i was
4:41
so excited because you know homecoming's
4:42
like one of the first like big dances
4:44
that happens in the beginning of high
4:45
school and the brother schools
4:47
homecoming happened first before ours
4:49
and i got invited by this guy and i was
4:52
over the moon because like i said you
4:54
had to be like invited even though they
4:56
were our brother's school because one of
4:57
the guys had to take you and like so not
5:00
every girl at my high school got to go
5:02
but like a good chunk of them were going
5:04
because everybody was feral at that
5:05
point that's when my parents dropped the
5:08
bomb on me that for some reason we had
5:11
to go to chicago the weekend of my
5:13
brother's school's homecoming and i now
5:17
in hindsight it was not that big of a
5:18
deal but when you're that age and you
5:20
were like looking forward to something
5:22
and a boy had asked me kind of out it
5:25
kind of felt like the other world it did
5:26
feel like the other world i had a
5:28
meltdown i'll be honest 14 i was yelling
5:30
i was like no you can't make me go to
5:32
chicago i'm not going like why do we
5:34
have to go this weekend like my parents
5:35
like no you have to come because we have
5:36
to go and you're too young my brother's
5:38
even younger than me and i was like
5:39
absolutely not i'm not going like you
5:41
can't make me go i'll go stay with
5:42
grandma like please i was freaking out
5:45
and they were like this is not a big
5:46
deal because it wasn't my homecoming
5:48
they didn't really care because there
5:50
were two opportunities to go homecoming
5:51
brother's school in the sister school
5:52
and i didn't go to the brother school to
5:54
me too
5:56
me to me
5:58
yes i did have to go to both of them
5:59
long story short i did not get my way
6:01
and i ended up going to chicago so i had
6:03
to tell this guy i remember snapchatting
6:05
and being like so like i have to go to
6:06
chicago with my parents this weekend but
6:09
i can't go to homecoming with you but
6:10
like i still really like you he did not
6:12
give i was a little heartbroken i
6:15
remember being in chicago seeing all the
6:17
pictures of like all of the girls the
6:19
new friends i had made in high school i
6:21
was like sitting in a hotel room with my
6:22
brother in chicago viewing i wanted to
6:25
know so badly of who the guy took that
6:28
was supposed to take me t so i'm like
6:30
stalking t's instagram to be like who
6:32
did he take who did he take i heard
6:33
rumors of who he was taking
6:35
but i was like who did this guy end up
6:36
going take it i was hoping he was gonna
6:39
wait for me and not go to his homecoming
6:41
like what in the delusion but he went he
6:44
took somebody else and the other girl
6:45
really liked him so i kind of just gave
6:48
up
6:49
um i wasn't much of a fighter then i
6:51
wasn't gonna go fight for this man i
6:53
barely knew him i just thought he was
6:54
cute so so then i ran into the issue of
6:56
okay he's been stolen this other girl
6:58
went to homecoming with him he's a
6:59
stolen man we're not really talking
7:01
anymore at this point and i don't know
7:03
anybody and i wasn't going to be one of
7:04
those people that was going to take
7:05
somebody that they went to middle school
7:06
with so one of the girls that went to my
7:08
high school she had posted her
7:09
homecoming pictures from the brother
7:11
school homecoming and the guy that she
7:13
went with was really cute and i was like
7:16
oh i wonder if she likes him or if they
7:18
just went as friends but like i want to
7:20
figure out what's going on here because
7:22
i like this guy i'm not a homeworker
7:24
i've never been i wasn't gonna go
7:25
sabotage anything but i just wanted to
7:27
know what her vibes were like if you
7:28
don't want him i'll take him so call
7:31
this guy zach we'll call this guy zach i
7:33
was trying to be like sly but i was like
7:34
talking to people i was like so do you
7:36
think that um katie's gonna take zach to
7:39
homecoming cause zach took her people
7:41
like i don't think she likes him like
7:43
that and i was like oh okay i go to
7:44
another football game i see zach there
7:47
katie's not talking to him not
7:48
interacting with him i'm just kind of
7:50
standing there and i think somehow i
7:52
like like weaseled my way into like a
7:54
big group conversation that he was in
7:56
zack starts talking to me and he was
7:58
like very forward about it too like
8:00
there was not really like does he like
8:01
he does not he like immediately
8:02
gravitated towards me and then kind of
8:04
like separated from the group
8:05
conversation to like just talk to me we
8:08
were like hitting it off he was super
8:10
nice um this is a picture from this
8:12
exact night so this is what i looked
8:14
like i don't know why anybody was into
8:16
this gremlin looking ass cat 5 i had
8:18
going on but so after the football game
8:20
like we continued talking again really
8:22
sweet was like i thought you looked
8:23
really beautiful tonight like the corny
8:26
and but i was eating it up i was eating
8:28
all that up so i get back to school on
8:30
monday i
8:32
wanted to ask him to homecoming i was
8:34
like okay i really like this guy i want
8:35
to ask for homecoming but i did not want
8:37
bad blood with anybody i did not want to
8:40
come into high school and like cause any
8:42
problems this is so ironic now that i'm
8:44
editing this but after i graduated high
8:46
school like a couple weeks after katie
8:49
literally
8:50
tried to beat me up
8:53
literally tried to beat me up for no
8:54
reason like literally for no reason i
8:56
did i like don't really know her that
8:57
well i didn't really know that her wet
8:58
well and i was at a like party thing and
9:01
she tried picking me up
9:04
i straight up asked katie i was like hey
9:07
i've been talking to zach i feel like
9:09
you're not talking to him anymore but i
9:10
just want to double check do you want to
9:12
take him to our homecoming totally
9:14

9:15
immediately and she immediately was like
9:18
oh hell no i don't like him you can have
9:20
him like have fun and i was like okay
9:22
thank you
9:24
i asked her the homecoming in the most
9:26
corniest way i asked when homecoming the
9:27
most corny corny way the following
9:31
weekend at the next football game we
9:32

9:35
every friday the football game in the
9:37

11:44
already like he said he had such a great
11:45
night with me
11:47
we were texting constantly all
11:49
throughout like the school day after
11:50
school he'd always plan like okay friday
11:52
we're gonna go to the football game
11:53
we'll hang out there and everything or
11:55
sometimes it's a saturday but we always
11:57
plan to go to the football games like
11:58
meet up that was like the only time we
12:00
would like hang out it was so juvenile i
12:02
saw like once a week for like three
12:03
weeks and then the relationship was over
12:05
but this is what i'm trying to get out
12:06
here this guy had no red flags but also
12:09
i had negative two experience with any
12:11
of this so they may have just gone over
12:13
my head i really don't know two weeks
12:15
later like one friday for whatever
12:17
reason i decided i did not want to go to
12:20
one of the football games i don't know
12:21
why i didn't want to go because i knew
12:23
he was gonna be there i don't think
12:25
anything happened i don't think i wanted
12:27
to go i think i was tired and then this
12:28
is when i first started experiencing
12:30
fomo which still wrecks me to this day i
12:32
will plan on not going to something and
12:34

12:44
that zach is there and i was like
12:48

my brother's school so like i had known
13:51
this person for a while he comes up to
13:53
me and he's like hey i need to tell you

i don't know where he was eventually
14:37
zach ends up coming back to the big
14:38
crowd where i was and everybody else was
14:40
i was like where were you and he was
14:41
like oh i was just wandering around like

14:51
awkward so i we just continued the rest
14:53
of the evening like it was normal i went
14:55
home monday comes and texting him he's
14:58
like not replying very well i start
15:01
hearing less and less from him and
15:03
eventually he just stops replying and
15:06
another day goes by and like another day
15:08
goes by still haven't gotten a single
15:10
text from him i'm not blowing up his
15:12
phone but i'm like hey just want to make
15:13
sure you're good like my boyfriend just
15:17
stops replying all together i really
15:19
didn't know who to talk to to be like
15:21
why isn't zach replying so i just kind
15:22
of let it go and i never heard from him
15:25
again legitimately i never got another
15:27
text from this guy again
15:30
um so that's like how we like broke up i
15:33
didn't go to the football game i think
15:34
that weekend because i was upset i think
15:36
i was being petty i was like this dude
15:37
won't even reply to me i'm not even
15:39
going to like go to the football game on
15:40
the chance that i see him like i don't
15:41
even want to talk to him so i didn't go
15:43
still no text i never hear from this guy
15:44
again so i got back to school on monday
15:46
after i skipped out on going to the last
15:48
football game i think it was like the
15:49
last one possibly i don't quite remember
15:52
the football games were not that crucial
15:53
it was just like the meeting spot where
15:55
i would see zach everybody is talking
15:57
about how zach told everybody that he's
15:59
been [ __ ] his stepsister
16:02
and
16:04
i was like
16:06
excuse me and more people and more
16:09
people were like yeah yeah like he was
16:10
talking about it at the football game
16:12
he's been like telling guys that he goes
16:14
to school and like a lot of the girls
16:15
were dating other guys at the brother
16:18
school where zach went it was basically
16:19
like we were in the same high school so
16:20
like yeah jack told me that zach was
16:23
telling everybody and like yeah i also
16:24
heard that like so many people knew this
16:27
because i guess he was going around to
16:29
everybody telling everybody and their
16:31
mother that he was being his stepsister
16:34
because they weren't blood oh
16:37
hell no so this man decides to ghost me
16:41
never speak to me again out of literally
16:43
nowhere and then i find out from
16:46
literally half my high school that um he
16:48
is hooking up with his step-sister when
16:50
is it my turn to be happy i text him one
16:53
more time and i'm trying to get a hold
16:54
of him i didn't even say that i knew
16:56
anything about it i just texted him one
16:58
more time and i was like hey and the
17:00
text didn't deliver
17:03
did he block me like what is going on i
17:05
just gave up at that point i was like
17:07
this dude is a weirdo he doesn't want
17:10
anything to do with me clearly i guess
17:12
he's more occupied with his stepsister
17:15
um keep in mind i just had my first kiss
17:18
with this person and then two weeks
17:20
later i guess he's um canoodling with
17:22
his family members that makes me feel
17:25
great
17:26
so
17:27
i know there's probably people that are
17:28
gonna be like there's no way there's
17:29
nothing i have proof the only form of
17:31
proof i have because this happened so
17:32
long ago i've had multiple phones i
17:33
don't have text messages from 2014. the
17:36
only proof is i posted on my finsta one
17:39
time that has all my personal friends on
17:40
it i posted just being like lol remember
17:42
when my first boyfriend like ended up
17:44
like
17:45
his stepsister does anybody remember
17:47
that two people commented i'll block out
17:49
their name two people commented they
17:50
went to high school with me they go oh
17:51
my god i remember when people told me
17:53
about his stepsister and i was like holy
17:54
[ __ ] brooke dodged a bullet another kid
17:56
who went to high school with him was
17:57
like did he go to the high school that
17:59
they went to because i know exactly who
18:01
you're talking about i guess he thought
18:03
it was like cool he was like high five
18:04
bro like
18:05
my step-sister what's up like people
18:08
were like that doesn't happen in real
18:09
life it's not a thing that people do
18:10
like sweet home alabama baby like that's
18:12
not real why are you doing that months
18:15
later the brother school would have
18:16
these like informal dances like you
18:18
didn't have to be invited to go you just
18:19
had to go to either my school or their
18:21
school and that was the first time that
18:23
i had seen zach since we broke up i've
18:26
never told him that i knew how do you
18:28
even bring that up i just don't know how
18:30
to bring that up in casual conversation
18:32
at all and it was so awkward when we saw
18:35
each other the next time because we were
18:37
dating and then he just never replies to
18:39
me again i did ask about that though i
18:41
went up to him and i was like hey
18:43
hey
18:44
[Music]
18:47
he told me that his phone broke
18:50
he told me that his phone broke he said
18:52
that he dropped his phone it shattered
18:54
and it took him like multiple weeks to
18:56
get a new one and he like i think he
18:58
told me he still didn't have a new phone
19:00
yet it was the weirdest response i bet
19:02
like we just never talked again
19:04
i ended up like never really having to
19:06
interact with zach again because he
19:08
ended up getting kicked out from our
19:10
brother's school is what i was told i
19:12
heard that he got kicked out for selling
19:14
weed and then my freshman year of
19:16
college i came home for the summer we
19:19
still had each other on social media
19:20
once again i told you i never told him
19:22
that i knew i kind of just acted like i
19:24
didn't know he texts me and he goes i've
19:26
been seeing your insta lately like
19:27
you're not the little girl that i used
19:29
to know and i was like
19:31
he was like so like when are we gonna
19:33

19:35
sir
19:36
it has been four years and i know that
19:40
you
19:41

19:42
sister i have no desire of ever hanging
19:45
out with you um i just never replied and
19:47
then i think he unfollowed me on
19:49
instagram because i think he was salty
19:51
