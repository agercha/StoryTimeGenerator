my hat says [ __ ] feelings but I actually
0:01
have a lot of feelings I'm just trying
0:03
to be trendy and I'm also wearing a
0:06
onesie his pants that I was gonna try to
0:07
cover that up but it just I'm a mess
0:10
hi guys it's Tana mojo I hope you were
0:13
having a really awesome day today so
0:15
today's video is going to be a story
0:19
time video if you will kind of story
0:21
time kind of not about some crazy dreams
0:25
that I've had and a really quick like
0:28
fun fact about me is that I have always
0:31
had incredibly vivid dreams my entire
0:35
life and when I say vivid I mean like so
0:39
vivid like so vivid and you know when
0:42
most people wake up from their dreams
0:44
they like can't remember them I don't
0:46
have that problem at all every dream
0:49
I've like ever happened like I remember
0:51
it as vividly as when I was dreaming it
0:54
also in my dreams my dreams always only
0:59
involve me and like the same eight or
1:02
nine people like there's never really
1:04
random people in my dreams sometimes
1:07
they'll be celebrities or they'll be
1:08
like extras if you will like random
1:11
people in the background of my dreams
1:13
but like the main characters of my
1:15
dreams are always the same people it
1:18
will either be like my mom and my dad or
1:20
like my best friends are like my
1:22
boyfriend or just like basically that
1:24
that's it like my close friends and my
1:26
family and my boyfriend like there's
1:28
never really any other people in my
1:30
dreams and every single night I have
1:33
four to five vivid vivid dreams I can
1:36
wake up and literally tell you every
1:38
single one and every single thing that
1:40
happens in them and it's been that way
1:42
my entire life I have no idea why but
1:44
yeah it's super weird also if I like
1:46
wake up in the middle of the night
1:47
during a dream like no matter what when
1:50
I go back to sleep that dream will like
1:52
resume it's not that I like lucid dream
1:55
or that I can control my dreams because
1:57
I can't do either one and have no desire
1:59
to do either one it's just that my
2:01
dreams themselves are very vivid and
2:04
and I wake up I mean even if I like wait
2:06
30 minutes if I go back to sleep the
2:08
dream will continue I don't know it's
2:10
really really really weird but yeah so I
2:15
often have the most weirdest dreams when
2:18
they involve my boyfriend and I had some
2:22
really weird dreams in the last like
2:24
three or four months that involved him
2:26
and the other day he gave me the idea to
2:29
tell these dreams on camera and I was
2:32
like damn that's a really really good
2:33
idea like thank you for this idea but
2:35
yeah he gave me this idea to tell them
2:37
on camera and I thought that it was just
2:39
a really really good idea because they
2:41
are crazy
2:41
so yeah today's video is a storytime but
2:45
not a storytime involving some weird
2:48
dreams that involve my boyfriend and
2:51
yeah so dream number one is the
2:55
inspiration for this video and by far
2:57
the like strangest of the three if you
3:00
will and I never really understood girls
3:03
when they would get mad at their like
3:05
boyfriends for something that they did
3:08
in a dream because I'm like it's a dream
3:09
you can't get mad at someone for
3:11
something they did in a dream like
3:12
that's crazy
3:13
and then I have this dream and I
3:14
literally woke up and called him and I
3:16
was like okay like I get it whatever
3:18
like this happened in a dream but the
3:20
[ __ ] dream verse knew he was a piece
3:22
of [ __ ] and was like literally in a
3:24
pissy mood for like 45 minutes like I'm
3:26
not even getting you I was literally in
3:28
a pissy mood because of this dream so
3:31
the dream started off in a house party
3:34
and this house party had all of my best
3:37
friends like around me like there and
3:39
the person throwing the house party was
3:41
someone that I don't really like it was
3:43
actually the guy that I talked about in
3:46
my one of my q and A's with my heart
3:49
attack date story it was that guy that
3:52
was hosting the party and so me and my
3:55
boyfriend went to the party and like my
3:57
best friend's or with us as food him at
4:00
all yeah so wrong with the party and
4:04
there are these three girls at this
4:06
party and these three girls are three
4:08
girls that I don't really like and I
4:10
don't dislike a lot of people so this is
4:12
weird that all these people I dislike or
4:14
like in this dream I
4:15
like have problems with a lot of people
4:17
at all but yeah there were these three
4:18
girls that I didn't like and one of the
4:21
girls I did not like because she is like
4:24
a homewrecker how if you will
4:26
she's very catfished she annoys me no
4:29
talking [ __ ] nothing like that just not
4:31
my cup of tea the other two girls are
4:33
the definition of like party drug head
4:37
like I do I'm not going anywhere in life
4:39
I use everyone like those kind of girls
4:42
don't like any of those three girls my
4:44
friend group isn't close with them like
4:46
they're just not my cup of tea like they
4:47
steal from people
4:48
sketchy don't like that they were in the
4:51
stream and so in this dream they're
4:54
right like the party was in this house
4:55
and there was a big fire outside and
4:58
nobody knew about the fire but me for
5:01
some reason and it was a bunch of RVs
5:03
catching on fire in my dream so I went
5:06
outside with the owner of the party like
5:08
the owner of the house the guy that I
5:10
don't like and we put out all the fires
5:12
and I come back inside and I go upstairs
5:15
in the house and my boyfriend is having
5:18
a foursome like a threesome know him in
5:20
the three girls a foursome with these
5:22
three girls in my dream like he's like
5:25
[ __ ] all four this is so insane oh my
5:30
but yeah we weren't dating at the time
5:32
when I have this dream or we weren't
5:33
like dating my dream I had they're like
5:34
we were just like talking if you little
5:36
but still whatever anyways that doesn't
5:38
really matter I'm just stating that I
5:40
feel like I'm settling a story with my
5:41
boyfriend cheated on me but he didn't
5:42
it's a dream do you see like that's how
5:44
vivid it was anyways so yeah I walk in
5:48
on my boyfriend like for summing these
5:50
three girls that I hate and I'm like
5:53
trying to break it up and in real life I
5:55
would not try to break it up I would
5:57
just be like peace the [ __ ] out you're a
5:58
ho euro euro ho I'm breaking up with you
6:01
bye and I would leave but in this dream
6:04
I was literally trying to like pry these
6:06
girls off of my boyfriend it was so
6:08
[ __ ] weird and he like wasn't and
6:11
that's why I was like so mad like in my
6:13
dream I was like fighting with them to
6:15
get off him and he like didn't want them
6:17
to get off him that's why I was like so
6:19
mad when I called him I was like you
6:20
[ __ ] hung like you're a hoe but
6:23
anyways yeah it was a dream and then so
6:24
I leave the house and the
6:26
fires still going on outside and I'm
6:28
trying to call him to be like hey like
6:30
there's a fire which in real life I
6:32
would be like burn in hell like [ __ ] you
6:35
but um yeah I was trying to tell him
6:37
there's a fire and then he's like oh I'm
6:39
at my house now and so I like drive to
6:41
his house did I Drive I can't remember I
6:45
walked or drove I don't know so yeah
6:48
dream me walk through the house I show
6:50
up and I'm like do you have a [ __ ]
6:51
explanation for this like are you
6:53
kidding me like I can't believe you
6:55
would do that and he's like I don't want
6:56
to talk about it I'm playing a video
6:58
game that made me dream me even more mad
7:00
and then I walked outside of his house
7:02
and like every X I've ever had and like
7:05
old friends were like is there to
7:07
consult me and it was like the weirdest
7:09
dream in my whole life and I woke up and
7:10
I called him and I was like [ __ ] you
7:13
yeah it was that was a weird dream dream
7:15
number two I briefly talked about in a
7:17
QA but me and my boyfriend weren't
7:19
dating yet so I kind of like didn't tell
7:22
the whole story of the dream because I
7:23
didn't know what to refer to us as if
7:25
that makes sense like I didn't want to
7:26
like create a bunch of questions from it
7:29
but now that we are official when I can
7:31
talk about whatever the hell I want to
7:33
hi I'm gonna tell you the story of a
7:36
really weird dream so over the summer
7:38
before I started dating him we lived in
7:41
this apartment this isn't like a dream
7:43
I'm giving you some backstory we lived
7:45
in this apartment because we have a
7:47
long-distance relationship he goes to
7:48
college in Reno but over summer he comes
7:51
home to Vegas because that's where he's
7:52
from so we lived in this like
7:53
month-to-month apartment basically for
7:57
those three months and in that apartment
7:59
it was him and his best friend they like
8:02
owned it and we would just have our
8:03
friends over all the time it was a
8:04
really really good time it was really
8:06
fun so in this dream I was in the
8:09
apartment right and I was like alone at
8:12
first completely alone and I went in our
8:14
room and I went to sleep in the dream
8:17
just practicing again in the dream so I
8:19

8:48
bed of the guy that I'm talking to you
8:50

8:54
boyfriend comes in the room to see it
8:56
and he's like what the [ __ ] is going on
8:58

8:59

9:18
like that and then he starts projectile
9:20
vomiting onto me but it's not like
9:23
regular vomit it's like green and it was
9:26
like the prettiest turquoise green ever
9:29
I know that's really weird that I like

9:40
projectile vomiting into my mouth and
9:42

9:44
not going everywhere it's like a direct
9:46
hose stream of vomit in my mouth and
9:49
it's green and I have this hair toner
9:52
that smells just like a green apple and
9:55
the vomit tasted just the way my hair
9:57
toner smell that's literally how vivid
9:59
my dreams are like taste smell touch
10:01

10:04
so then you vomits like into my mouth
10:06
for like 3 minutes it was like a stream
10:08
it was weird and then he gets up and
10:10
leaves the like apartment because he's
10:12
like mad and then I go out into the room
10:14
and all of a sudden all of our best
10:16
friends are like there and they're like
10:18
couples like it's all of our friends
10:19
that are other couples like there's not
10:20
like just one person it's like all of
10:23

10:25
they're all standing there like I can't
10:27
believe you cheated on him I can't
10:29
believe you got with someone else Ted I
10:30
can't believe you and then I was trying
10:33
to like explain it to them and like
10:35
couldn't like might like it wasn't like
10:37
working and then so I go like chase
10:39
after him and he's just vomiting like
10:42
projectile everywhere outside and I like
10:45
couldn't like I literally couldn't like
10:47

10:50
up in the apartment
10:51
I have this room in the apartment he was
10:52

11:31
before we went on this adventure and so
11:34

we were there I got a knock on the door
11:37
and the door was like big and glass and
11:40

13:00
so there's this really crazy girl that
13:03
is a
13:04
friends of a lot of people that I'm
13:06
friends with I don't really like her
13:07

it is but yeah I don't know why my
13:13
dreams really involve people that I
13:14
don't like a lot but yeah so there's
13:17
this really crazy girl that I'm not a
13:18
big fan of in life and in my dream
13:21
so I'd lay down for a nap and I wake up
13:24
and my boyfriend's gone and there's a
13:26
letter that like she is with my
13:28
boyfriend like that she's kidnapped him
13:30
like left for me to find basically so
13:33
then I go on this journey and I'm with
13:35
this old couple it's like a random old
13:37
couple like not old but they're like 55
13:40
like 50 and they help me hike this
13:43
mountain then it's like made up of these
13:45
small stones and the stones all have
13:47
brandy melville stickers on them I don't
13:49
know why but yeah so I hiked this
13:51
mountain when I get to the top of this
13:53
mountain there's a flag and on the flag
13:55
it's like a United States flag and on
13:57
the flag there's a post-it note from the
13:59
girl it was a pink post-it note
14:01
literally my dreams are so vivid and I
14:03
read it and she's like your boyfriend is
14:04
here like you have like like four
14:06
minutes and something to save him and it
14:09
took me like hours in this dream to hike
14:11
this mountain so that I have to get down
14:13
this hour hike mountain in like four
14:15
minutes so I'm like running hopping the
14:17
stones like falling and I get to the
14:20
bottom and my boyfriend is like tied to
14:21
this tree he's like handcuffed to this
14:24
tree and there's only he's like big men
14:26
in suits with like big guns like
14:29
protecting him like not letting me get
14:31
to them like they're gonna shoot me if I
14:32
try to get to it hey man apparently
14:34
those guys were hired like by the crazy
14:37
girl so that I one by one in the stream
14:40
take their guns and I'm like banging
14:43
them in the head with it like I'm not
14:44
killing them but I'm like knocking them
14:46
out and finally I get to him and I like
14:48
untie all of the rope and he's like
14:51
[ __ ] up his eyes are like big and his
14:53
face is like melting and then so I'm
14:55
like trying to like I'm like saving his
14:57
life basically getting him back to
14:59
consciousness and so I start carrying
15:00
his body back to my grandma's house in
15:03
Texas and then I find this big like
15:06
Christmas box and I open it and it's a
15:08
letter from the crazy girl saying that
15:10
she gave him like 20 hits of like acid
15:13
like LSD and that it was gonna like kill
15:16
him if I did
15:17
survive him and then all of a sudden all

15:21
the day and they like saved his life and
15:23
arrested the girl who was hiding under
15:25
