Wait wait wait wait! Before you unsubscribe. (laughing) I'm dyeing it back in two weeks, okay?
0:06
I feel like before I even get into the video I have to address the fact that I have pink hair
0:10
I don't know, I've always, always wanted pink hair. Like, my entire life, I've wanted to just do it
0:16
once, I wanted to just say "fuck it". I don't want it to be any other hair color, because I know it's not going to look good.
0:21
Blonde me is a thing. I look like Michael Jackson with any other hair color.
0:25
It's like, holiday break right now. I have to grow out my hair anyways 'cause of my scalp — just Tana things, Tana problems.
0:32
I can't bleach my scalp until January, right before I go on tour, so I've been having to grow out my roots, and I was like, "you know what while I have roots and while I'm not doing anything to my hair, I'm just going to say fuck it, and I'm going to dye it pink." So I took my happy ass to Hot Topic today.
0:45
-laughing-
0:46
and I bought some pink hair dye and now
0:48
my hair is pink. I did it myself
0:50
also to my hairdresser you don't know this is
0:52
happening. You might be watching this I'm
0:54
really sorry. I just know
0:56
she is mad. She is going to deck me in the fucking face.
0:58
Next time she see me. She always tells me to
1:00
never do anything to my hair. But yeah, it's semi-permanent
1:02
and as soon as I go back blonde for
1:04
tour, like, in a month or so I'll be
1:06
blonde again. So I thought for a month
1:08
I would have pink hair, and I'm not going to lie I
1:10
really fucking like it. And I'm
1:12
really really really proud of myself
1:14
for doing something I said I was never
1:16
going to do. Jumping out of my fucking
1:18
ultimate comfort zone.
1:20
My ultimate comfort zone is my blonde hair.
1:22
I'm not even kidding you. That's the one thing
1:24
that I, like, consider my comfort zone. So the fact that
1:26
I have pink hair and I dig it is really
1:28
fucking cool. Wise words of my mother
1:30
who actually gave birth to me, I actually came out of her
1:32
pussy, Jenna Marbles, "life is
1:34
way too fucking short not to have fun
1:36
ass hair", so here I am, with
1:38
fun, pink hair! If you're gonna unsubscribe
1:40
'cause my hair's not blonde anymore, just wait a month
1:42
just 30 days, like, whatever, like, like me for my
1:44
personality. Go look at my old videos.
1:46
Like, if you're a guy and you're new here, like, and you'd
1:48
pipe blonde me, just, like, go watch those videos.
1:50
Wait a month, okay? So now [laughs]. Hi guys, it's
1:54
Tana Mongeau, and I don't know if you guys
1:56
know this — if you know me, you know this —
1:58
I fly so much.
2:00
I just got back from the airport, probably, like,
2:02
5 hours ago, and I'm leaving for the airport
2:04
again in, like, 3 hours. I'm always working
2:06
I'm always travelling to Los Angeles
2:08
I'm always fucking on a plane, going somewhere.
2:10
Like, I literally need my own plane.
2:12
If there are any sugar daddies out there and you just, like, wanna buy me a plane, like,
2:14
my business email's below.
2:16
[laughs] I'm just kidding.
2:18
2:20
2:21
But really, I'm always flying on planes, and
2:24
I wanted to do this for a while. And if you guys have been here
2:26
since, like, the beginning, I used to do this series
2:28
a little more, where I would make a video
2:30
and I would have a bunch of mini storytimes
2:32
all in one — like, I'm just telling you, like
2:34
four or five stories in one video
2:35
or, like, three or four, whatever.
2:37
And today I thought it would be really fun
2:38
to tell you guys some of my bad flight slash
2:41
bad airport experiences, all compiled into
2:44
1 video. So that's what I'm going to do
2:46
today. I'm going to tell you guys some
2:48
bad airport, bad flight attendant, bad
2:50
plane experience storytimes, and I have
2:52
some great ones for you.
2:54
So yeah! Before I get into this video, if
2:56
you have not subscribed, I mean, like, tits,
2:59
a story, like, I talk, like, I'm kinda funny,
3:01
like, maybe you could do it, like, I
3:02
normally I have blonde hair and I'm, like,
3:03
fuckable, like, it's, like, a thing, like, you
3:05
know? Subscribe! I'm just kidding.
3:07
But really yeah, if you haven't subscribed
3:09
you should subscribe. And if you have subscribed, you
3:11
should follow all my social media below
3:12
especially my snapchat and my Instagram
3:15
because we're close to a million. It
3:16
would be fun. Okay. I'm gonna shut up now.
3:18
I'm sorry for all of the shameless promo
3:20
and pink hair and whatever the fuck else
3:21
I'm talking about. Hi. I love you.
3:23
Let's get into the stories. I've never
3:25
flown Spirit Airlines. I'm not a fan of
3:28
Spirit Airlines I feel like it's in the
3:31
same classification as Allegiant and
3:34
Allegiant is by far my least favorite
3:37
airline I don't know if you follow me on
3:38
twitter it's all I fucking tweet about
3:40
for like a month on tour my entire to
3:42
over the last two months every single
3:43
stop I told the story about how much I
3:45
hate Allegiant airlines, had a bad
3:47
experience on Allegiant airlines, I'll
3:48
eventually tell that story on camera for
3:50
anybody who didn't go to my tour shows
3:51
but I just fucking hate Allegiant Airlines
3:53
It is literally the fucking scum of airlines
3:57
and spirit airlines is like right there
3:59
with Allegiant. Really really cheap
4:00
flight prices but everything else
4:03
fucking sucks so that they can
4:05
compromise for their cheap flight prices
4:07
if that makes sense. And something that I just
4:09
found out about Spirit Airlines is that
4:10
the times that they tell you their
4:12
flights are going to take off at, like
4:13
let's say you buy a flight for like 7:15 a.m whatever,
4:15
Spirit puts in their fine print
4:18
that "those times are only a suggestion"
4:21
A SUGGESTION
4:22
A SUGGESTION!
4:23
I don't know if you get what
4:24
that means but like basically like every
4:26
other line like when they say a time
4:28
they mean it like Spirit puts that in
4:30
their fine print so then when you check
4:31
their like, I agree box, you're agreeing
4:33
to the fact that you can buy a flight
4:35
for 7:15 a.m. and it can leave at 4pm for
4:38
no reason and you can't get a refund, you
4:40
can't get on a later flight, you can't
4:41
complain,
4:42
nothing, because the time that they told
4:44
you they were just suggesting that the
4:45
plane MIGHT leave at that time like
4:47
that's how shitty of an airline Spirit
4:49
airlines is and that's why I never flew it.
4:52
But one day I was in Los Angeles and I had
4:54
to fly home the next day for a hair
4:56
appointment. I'm so sorry to my hair lady
4:58
again if you're still watching this, she's
4:59
probably just watching this like, in
5:00
fucking awe of how much of a dumb bitch I am
5:02
but like, whatever. I needed to fly on super
5:04
early i'm talking like 5-6am early so
5:07
that i could be at my 830am hair
5:08
appointment the next day and no other
5:10
airlines had flights early enough so I
5:13
booked a flight with spirit airlines and
5:15
the suggested time was 530am so i get to
5:19
LAX falling asleep in the fucking chair
5:21
i get on the plane and they don't have
5:22
like first-class it's all just like one
5:25
plane of like the most smushed together
5:27
seats you'll ever see
5:29
it's like three tiny assets like no
5:31
armrests nothing all smushed together in
5:34
a row so i went ahead and got the very
5:36
first seats on the road because they
5:37
have like the big seat as the very first
5:40
row instead of three seats must enroll
5:42
it's only to sow the seeds like normal
5:44
size it's a little bigger
5:47
it reclines a little bit more it's just
5:49
like one tiny baby step up from like
5:53
their shitty seats
5:54
I wouldn't even call it a step I'm
5:55
calling a tow I got those seats though
5:57
so I was sitting in the very front row
5:59
and so now we get into the story time I
6:01
just want to give you guys a little
6:02
consensus so as I'm boarding the plane
6:05
the flight attendant always stands at
6:07
the very beginning of the plane to like
6:08
greet you before you sit down so it's
6:10
535 a.m. and the Sun hasn't even began
6:14
to like rise
6:16
I am fucking exhausted like don't speak
6:20
to me
6:20
don't look at me don't read this thing
6:22
areas we don't fucking cough around me
6:24
give you a baby fucking choke it i don't
6:28
want to be looked at like that's how
6:29
fucking tired IM and so I'm walking out
6:31
of the plane I'm like my eyes are like
6:34
closed and all of a sudden I hear good
6:36
morning welcome to spirit airlines and
6:39
I'm just like it's five thirty five in
6:45
the morning like you're really that
6:46
fucking happy to be here and doing your
6:48
job and i know i'm sitting here
6:49
criticizing like how happy someone is
6:51
but like fuck bitch where like are you on coke are you on speed or are you on
6:56
adderall, are you on redbull like how are you that
6:59
like fuck hi I love my job
7:02
and you work for spirit airline and i was like why
7:03
are you that happy and so I say nothing to her
7:06
because I would just like like I nodded
7:08
my head I tried to open my eyes I tried
7:10
to be respectful but that's all i could
7:12
muster and so as I'm walking away
7:14
I hear you're not going to say
7:15
goodmorning back literally like back
7:18
like are you a mess like where is your
7:21
crack spoon holy fuck, so i turn around and
7:23
I'm like good morning
7:25
and then I'm walking my feet and she's
7:29
like that's better
7:31
and I'm like gonna be a long fly so I
7:36
sit down in my seat the rest of the
7:37
plane boards as the plane is boarding
7:39
she's walking up and down the aisles
7:40
just monitoring things that people are
7:43
doing she was absolutely one hundred
7:45
percent one of those people that are
7:48
just so obsessed with doing their job
7:51
perfectly and so obsessed with like
7:54
being meticulous and like anal and my
7:56
crazy like she literally masturbates
7:58
that night to like how she can be a
7:59
better flight attendant and I'm like
8:01
those people I get it you're an
8:02
overachiever like that's amazing but
8:03
fuck like it's a 5:35 in the morning you work
8:06
with spirit airlines like why do you
8:08
care this much i feel like if i worked for
8:10
spirit airlines and it was 5:35 in the
8:11
morning I'll be like just crashed the
8:12
fucking plane like and I jumped out like
8:14
i don't i didn't get the mindset
8:16
she's walking up and down the aisles
8:17
opening the overhead compartments like
8:19
turning people's luggage like a
8:20
90-degree angle so that it's like in the
8:22
overhead compartment perfectly like
8:24
walking up to people and taking their
8:27
headphones out of their ears so that
8:29
they are prepared to listen to the
8:31
safety announcement getting in people's
8:33
personal fucking space to take the
8:36
safety booklet out turn it around so
8:38
it's like facing the right way like in
8:39
the seatback pocket walking up to people
8:41
and like forcing them to chug their
8:43
drinks so that like they don't spill
8:46
while taking off and like that's not
8:47
even a rule like you're allowed to have
8:48
drinks while taking out like what the
8:50
fuck she wants them to this kid with a
8:51
skateboard and is like so I see you have
8:53
a skateboard
8:55
i need like yeah and she's like rule 38
8:59
of spirit airlines prohibit skateboards
9:01
being actively open on a plane you're
9:02
going to put in your carry-on go ahead
9:04
and go outside the death can check it
9:05
and he's like security let me take it
9:08
like this it's all I have
9:09
I don't have a carry-on or checked bag
9:11
actually looks at me like well then you
9:13
can't fly
9:15
can you and then he kept trying to talk
9:17
me like it's literally all I have like
9:18
i'll put in the overhead compartment
9:20
like although check and just let it like
9:21
rollout of the security that's what you
9:23
want as she keeps interrupting him being like a rule
9:25
38 prohibit 38
9:27
prohibits spirit airlines rule 38
9:28
prohibits that you take a skateboard
9:30
openly on the plane and literally made
9:33
this human being
9:34
get off of the plane and not fly so
9:37
finally she resumed her little position
9:39
in the front of the plane prepared to
9:40
give the safety announcement is
9:42
literally standing there waiting for the
9:44
safety announcement like shit to come on
9:46
and she's standing like this like posing
9:50
for the fucking announcement at five
9:53
thirty in the morning like are you
9:55
sane like where is your fucking
9:58
sanity like this is all she had
10:00
ok one hundred percent of the CEO spirit
10:02
airlines would fucking come at this
10:04
bitch because like she literally was
10:05
like a robot so right before she's
10:07
about to do a little announcement like
10:08
she's literally standing there like this
10:10
she looks at me because i'm sitting in
10:12
the seat right in front of her because I
10:14
mean like the front row seat i'm sitting
10:15

10:30
that as the place like landing I don't
10:32
probably gonna die early anyway so I'm
10:33
not here like actively trying to like to
10:35
save my life by putting it on airplane
10:36
mode and like honestly if a fucking
10:38
plane that can propel itself like in the
10:40
air is going to crash because my phone
10:42
isn't on airplane mode let it burn
10:46
let's go im ready so sitting on my phone
10:48
texting and I'm texting my hair
10:50
lady like what time im going to land like
10:51
something it was something like decent
10:53
important and those things are
10:54
looking at my phone and all of a sudden
10:56
I feel fucking mrs. spirit cock in her
10:59

10:59
this close to my face I'm sitting there
11:01
on my phone and I just feel my phone
11:04

11:38
gasoline and a fucking match like a
11:41

11:42
phone and I look up and I'm like
11:43
literally and she's like I'm sorry I
11:48
thought your phone was supposed to be on
11:50

12:04
phone like my text messages are like on
12:06
my phone like the text i'm typing swipes
12:08

12:10
forcefully as humanely possible like
12:12
literally like borderline hurt my hand
12:14
goes and like slaps it back into my hand
12:17
and goes back to her little spirit
12:19
airlines fucking position and then she
12:22
goes are doing the safety announcement
12:23
and the entire time during the safety
12:25
announcement if anyone is sleeping stops
12:27
the safety on announcement to go wake
12:29
them up if anyone has headphones will
12:31
walk to the back of the plane stops the
12:33
safety announcement takes the headphone
12:34
now all of these people that are doing
12:36
these things she's warning like if they
12:38
do it again they're gonna have to get
12:39
off of the flight literally delays the
12:41
flight like we're supposed to land at
12:42
six-thirty and we landed like 720
12:44
because she kept stopping the safety
12:46
announcement to like make sure people
12:47
were paying attention so that the plane
12:49
takes off and the entire rest of the
12:52
flight like waking sleeping people to
12:54
ask if they want drinks getting in
12:55
people's face like push their carry-ons
12:57
further under their seats asking people
12:59
to quietly halt their baby from crying
13:02
because it is disturbing others i can
13:04
you stop your baby we're going without
13:06
having like babies but like what are you
13:07
doing give it an actually I don't know
13:10
plane lands literally is stopping by
13:12
everyone
13:13
it's like giving their trash being like
13:14
make sure to take this off the plane
13:16
cycle fucking minutes everyone gets off
13:18
she's reading them like to thank you my
13:19
spirit airlines they have a spirited day
13:21
I get off the plane and I will never
13:24
fucking fly suggested time as
13:27
crack spoon flight attendants weird
13:29
Airlines again and so the last one
13:32
happened very recently and this is a
13:34
very brief story i talked about on you
13:35
now and I think it's not about to stop
13:37
my talking on twitter
13:38
it was a fucking thing is the first time
13:39
I've ever been on a plane and literally
13:41
thought I was going to die and i
13:43
actually like bought the Wi-Fi in two
13:46
minutes to text my mom like I love you
13:48
so much i hope nothing happens to me
13:51
like that literally like that was how I
13:52
was feeling so I'm going out of Italy
13:54
Southwest flight love southwest flight
13:56
love Southwest Airlines fuckin sponsor
13:57
me plz like use cocaine and check out
13:59
like five dollars off sponsored so I'm
14:02
sitting on this plane and every time
14:04
that we take off to Vegas from Southwest
14:06
you take off like into the united states
14:09
like from California into Nevada why
14:11
would you fly the other way like in
14:12
devotion like it makes no fucking sense
14:14
I've slow this light like a million
14:17
times
14:18
immediately after sitting down I look
14:19
out the window and the plane is not
14:20
facing the normal we're in like the
14:22
normal place that is normally when I sit
14:24
on the plane look out the window like
14:26
whatever like I think nothing of it all
14:27
is that in the plane takes off and I was
14:29
thinking I'm like we were facing like
14:31
the ocean what are we going to take off
14:33
into the ocean like I don't I don't get
14:36
it
14:36
and my number-one like fear of dying
14:39
other than being burned alive I guess
14:42
would be drowning I am terrified of a
14:44
plane crashing in the water I'm honestly
14:46
not terrified at all really of a plane
14:49
like crashing in the ground like burning
14:51
because like the second plane crashes
14:53
you died upon impact if you don't die
14:54
the plane burst into flames and you're
14:56
dying like two fucking seconds it's not
14:57
really like that miserable of a death
14:59
and are really afraid not but I am
15:00
terrified of a plane crashing into water
15:04
and like you dying from drowning in the
15:05
water like that is just so miserable so
15:08
terrifying every time I fly over water
15:10
on a plane I have to close my eyes are
15:11
closed the window like it's something
15:13
I'm terrified of it and that definitely
15:14
didn't help the situation like in the
