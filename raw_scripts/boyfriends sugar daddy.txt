0:25

0:31

0:33
don't worry i got you i've been cutting
0:35
men's hair forever and i'm like
0:37
i have a lot of experience
0:40
and i should be able to work my magic on
0:42
you it was a baddie like i don't know if
0:44
she's gonna watch this video somehow
0:46
this woman was a baddie like she was
0:48
that girl that woman so i just really
0:51
trusted her
0:52
um and
0:56
it's not giving rihanna all i have to
0:58
say is when they take a ton of photos of
1:00
you and they post all their other
1:02
clients but they don't post you that's
1:04
how they know they [ __ ] up so we're
1:06
going to be wearing this wig today this
1:08
was made by
1:10
this wig was made by mac wigs at lisa
1:13
mac
1:14
um i found her on instagram i reached
1:16
out to my girlies and i was like y'all i
1:17
need a wig she's battered she's torn so
1:20
she will be making an appearance later
1:22
on in the video i don't like to do my
1:23
makeup with my wig on because if you can
1:25
tell like i've gotten foundation on the
1:28
wig so i don't want to make that even
1:29
worse she's going to lay right here on
1:31
my hello kitty pillow until she's needed
1:33
today's video is going to be a get ready
1:35
with me hopefully right i hope
1:38
my girl don't go out looking like that
1:39
so today's gonna be a get ready with me
1:41
slash a story time that i tried to film
1:43
this video like a month and a half ago
1:45
and consecutively every other week i
1:47
kept trying to film it just something
1:48
kept going wrong like the first time the
1:50
audio got [ __ ] up the second time my
1:52
friend said i shared way too many
1:53
details so told me to film it again
1:55
filmed it a third time and the audio got
1:57
[ __ ] up again so here we are again for
1:58
the fourth time trying to share this
2:00
story maybe that's the universe telling
2:02
me that this man is gonna try to sue me
2:05
so for the sake of defamation everything
2:08
i'm about to tell you is a lie i totally
2:10
came up with all this in my head okay
2:12
sweetie so today we're gonna do a very
2:13
light beat i have absolutely no plans
2:15
and nothing to do per usual but i like
2:18
to do my makeup and get ready in the
2:19
morning because it just genuinely makes
2:21
me feel better so why not chat with the
2:23
girlies show off my new growth so this
2:26
story takes oh by the way like when i do
2:28
my get ready with me if you're new to my
2:29
channel i don't sit here like here's
2:31
each product like girl i'm not a beauty
2:33
guru you guys are here getting ready
2:34
with me i hope you're not learning from
2:37
me actually had somebody tell me oh my
2:38
god vanessa i want to be a makeup artist
2:39
because you taught me how to do makeup
2:41
and i never felt more lied to in my life
2:43
like it made me feel so good but at the
2:45
same time i was like damn y'all really
2:46
out here lying
2:48
okay let's get into this makeup also
2:50
you're gonna notice me like fidgeting
2:52
with my eye a lot i don't know what
2:53
happened but like i ripped off my false
2:55
lash and i try to rip off the glue
2:57
afterwards but i actually ripped the
2:58
skin off my eye you're probably
3:00
wondering how the [ __ ] does that happen
3:01
vanessa but like i literally ripped all
3:04
the skin on my lash line so we're
3:06
probably not gonna do lashes today so
3:08
this story takes place all the way back
3:10
in 2018 so this was quite a while ago
3:12
that's why i feel comfortable sharing
3:14
i'm not really
3:15
in connection with any of these people
3:17
so if anybody decides to pop up then
3:20
i
3:22
i don't know what to tell you i'm also
3:23
in the bible like if you've done me like
3:24
severely wrong in the past yeah i can
3:26
move and grow past it but like if i want
3:28
to share my story my experience i'm
3:30
gonna share it and
3:33
you should have done me wrong so this
3:35
was around the era when
3:37
i have many many questionable eras this
3:40
was my european era when i thought that
3:42
i could fly overseas and find a man
3:45
i thought i could fly overseas and bag
3:47
me a fish
3:48
it just ended a very
3:50
rollercoaster relationship with somebody
3:53
from overseas and a [ __ ] was feeling
3:55
lonely a bit just feeling desperate she
3:57
wanted some attention and like [ __ ]
3:59
cassie from euphoria i took the
4:02
attention from where i shouldn't have
4:04
ladies and gentlemen i've said this in
4:05
several videos not all attention is good
4:07
attention and you know what sometimes we
4:09
find ourselves in positions and
4:13
you know we bite the bait this was one
4:15
of those moments when i bit the bait um
4:17
somebody that i dated previously before
4:20
my european era
4:21
um this man used cheated lied the whole
4:27
i don't even know i am smiling [ __ ] it
4:29
was a mess he really thought he was the
4:30
[ __ ] in la and i thought i was the [ __ ]
4:34
under his arm even though i was paying
4:36
for all his ubers paying for all his
4:37
uber eats
4:38
paying for all his clothes paying
4:41
his mom man did me wrong he found a
4:43
whole model from miami had her fly out
4:46
dumped me the day before she showed up
4:48
for whatever [ __ ] reason being the
4:50
dumb [ __ ] i was after that situation
4:52
went away i decided to try again and i
4:54
flew out to go and meet all his family
4:56
and stuff and he ended up leaving me in
4:58
a hotel room the entire time so it was
4:59
very full circle so your girl moved on
5:01
she moved past it and of course like i
5:03
said i bit the bait and my dumbass ended
5:06
up
5:07
in
5:07
you know
5:08
this person's life again we were talking
5:10
24 7 like from waking up to going to
5:12
sleep like calling up face time 24 7. i
5:15
knew this person was on the other side
5:16
of the country but they did tell me that
5:18
they were always in la and at the time i
5:20
was flying in and out of la literally
5:21
like every month every couple weeks
5:23
because i was working on music
5:26
this was like around like the meditate
5:27
time so you know we figured that
5:30
whenever we were in la at the same time
5:32
we would link up or so i thought because
5:34
here i go you know flying out to l.a
5:36
letting them know i'm gonna be out there
5:37
so if at any point like you're gonna be
5:39
there too i'm gonna be there for maybe a
5:41
week and they made it seem like they
5:43
were constantly like in and out of the
5:44
city type thing so
5:46
which i don't know where the [ __ ] they
5:47
got all this money from because like i
5:49
said like the situation that i knew them
5:51
in was not you know an ideal one but all
5:53
of a sudden they were acting like you
5:55
know
5:55
they're up like they're successful they
5:58
got their mental health together they
5:59
got their everything together so that's
6:01
why i also entertained it like not only
6:03
because the bedroom lonely but because
6:05
you know
6:06
they spoke up a lot but you have to
6:08
remember that like people can talk a lot
6:11
they can really talk a bit of themselves
6:13
but if they don't show you then
6:15
kind of spill to my friend that i let
6:17
this person in my life again and i've
6:18
been talking to them and of course
6:20
they're like girl you better be careful
6:21
like you already know what happened last
6:23
time and me being you know me at the
6:26
time i was like oh i know what i'm doing
6:27
and then
6:28
you did not know what you were doing you
6:29
were
6:30
what 21 or 22. i did not know what i was
6:33
doing i really thought i knew everything
6:34
at that age so as i'm telling them about
6:36
this person they're looking at their
6:37
social media of course like you know let
6:39
me see what my [ __ ] is talking to
6:40
basically
6:42
and they're like oh my god they're in la
6:44
are you guys like meeting up soon and i
6:45
was like i did not know they were in la
6:47
what are you talking about and they
6:49
showed me a story and it was a very
6:50
obvious
6:51
landmark
6:53
from hollywood
6:54
so i was like oh my god like why didn't
6:56
he tell me that he was going to be in
6:58
l.a like i've been telling him for the
6:59
last you know a couple of weeks that i
7:00
was going to be out here so my friend
7:03
was like you should try to like reach
7:04
out and see if you guys can hang out i
7:05
have some stuff to do today anyway so
7:07
you guys should try to link or something
7:10
so it's like okay let's do that i hit
7:12
them up and immediately they're like oh
7:14
i meant to tell you that i was going to
7:15
be in l.a like i don't know why i didn't
7:17
tell you like it just slipped my mind i
7:18
was going to but we've been talking like
7:20
24 7 so like you're calling me at 7 00
7:23
am 12 p.m 3 p.m
7:26
8 p.m like where did it slip your mind i
7:28
was like why wouldn't you tell me and he
7:30
was like oh you know like it was just
7:32
slip of the mind so me being trusting
7:34
for whatever reason and like okay
7:36
maybe he's you know telling the truth
7:38
and he just forgot to tell me so i just
7:40
let it go and i'm like hey do you want
7:42
to hang out
7:43
and then here comes all the [ __ ]
7:44
excuses oh i don't think i can hang out
7:46
today like i don't want the person i'm
7:49
staying with to think that i'm using
7:50
them for a place to stay like you know
7:53
i've been here for a couple days and
7:55
i've been out and about so in my head
7:57
i'm like oh okay that makes sense like
7:59
you don't want your friend to feel like
8:01
you're only
8:02
there for a place to stay i mean me
8:04
personally if i were to ever stay like
8:06
steven's apartment and i had plans to go
8:08
hang out with you know someone else he
8:10
wouldn't even question it he wouldn't
8:11
feel weird about it because i used to
8:12
always stay at stephen's house
8:14
but i mean everybody's different i guess
8:16
so this kept happening for a couple days
8:19
like it was just a constant excuse of
8:20
like i can't get out like i don't want
8:22
this person to feel some sore way but
8:24
i'm only gonna be here for a week we
8:26
have you know been talking and you're
8:27
telling me that you want to be my man
8:29
again and you're telling me i'm not just
8:30
saying all this stuff spitting games so
8:32
i'm thinking like
8:33
this person would want to you know try
8:35
to see me but they're making it very
8:37
obvious that they were avoiding me in a
8:39
way that's how i felt so like you're
8:41
saying all this stuff over the phone but
8:43
like now we're literally only like 30
8:45
minutes away from each other so why
8:46
wouldn't you want to hang out with me so
8:48
just constant constant excuses so fast
8:51
forward i'm hanging out with that same
8:52
friend again in the hotel room and he's
8:54
like oh like i have an idea you should
8:55
film this video with them
8:57
so i reach out to them and conveniently
8:59
even though they couldn't hang out any
9:00
other time convenience like oh yeah i
9:02
could pop up right now i'll be there 30
9:04
minutes like oh okay now you're ready to
9:06
just show up because you're gonna
9:08
probably benefit from this somehow and
9:09
in that moment like i should have just
9:10
walked away completely but leaving me
9:13
after we filmed a video my friend ends
9:14
up leaving to go do whatever they were
9:16
doing at the time and he asked me like
9:18
oh do you want to go and get some food
9:19
in glendale so we went to the galleria
9:22
um kind of like area when i got some
9:24
xiao long bao from
9:25
is it called den tai fung it's like a
9:27
soup dumpling thing oh my god it's so
9:29
good that's my favorite food i'm not
9:30
gonna turn down my favorite food but the
9:32
whole time i'm just embarrassed and i'm
9:34
like oh my god why am i here why am i
9:35
doing this like no no he kept trying to
9:37
be flirty and trying to hold my hand and
9:38
[ __ ] and i just like i don't know i just
9:40
felt some sort of way after he leaves
9:42
one of my girlfriends came over and we
9:44
were just you know talking or whatever
9:45
and i kind of mentioned to her that
9:48
you know i was talking to him again a
9:49
little bit she already knew who he was
9:51
and this was like a newer friend so this
9:53
was a newer relationship so i kind of
9:54
told her a little bit about it but i
9:56
didn't tell her too much so what
9:58
happened next was very very confusing to
10:01
me and this girl literally is an fbi
10:03
agent a cia like not actually she's not
10:05
hired by them but if she applied i
10:07
wouldn't be surprised if she did because
10:09
i don't know how the [ __ ] she like
10:11
somehow put this all together while
10:13
we're hanging out she's just glued to
10:15
her phone the entire time and i'm like
10:16
this [ __ ] is up to something like i
10:18
just know she's up to something because
10:19
every time she's glued to her phone like
10:21
this she's gonna have to show me
10:22
something or like something's gonna pop
10:24
off and it's la so something is always
10:26
constantly popping off obviously not the
10:27
entire l.a county is like wild in but
10:30
like the community of people i was in
10:32
um yeah something was always popping off
10:34
so after her being glued to her phone
10:36
for like an hour and a half she's like i
10:38
have somebody that i want you to meet
10:39
and i have something i want to show you
10:40
something i want to tell you but i can't
10:42
tell you yet until you meet them and i'm
10:44
just like where are you on like this is
10:46
suspicious and i kept asking her a
10:47
million times and she would just keep
10:49
saying like no like you just have to
10:50
wait till you meet the person like [ __ ]
10:51
this better be [ __ ] justin
10:53
bieber okay like says i better pull up
10:55
because you are acting like this is the
10:57
most mysterious like like who are you
10:59
about to oh my god the eyeliner ain't
11:01
even sticking the skin is
11:03
the skin is rotting on my eye right now
11:05
but we're still gonna go ahead and try
11:07
to put some on anyways oh my god
11:11
probably shouldn't be doing this but you
11:12
know what um
11:15
i need it so the whole time that i'm
11:17
hanging out with her i'm also texting
11:18
him and i'm like i don't know why but
11:19
like she's being really sus right now
11:20
she's telling me that she has something
11:21
to show me and immediately like his tone
11:24
changes and he's like what do you mean
11:25
she has something to show you like she
11:27
has something like what are you talking
11:28
about i'm like whoa chill like why are
11:30
you getting all like freaked out now
11:32
like this this ain't even really your
11:34
friend like why are you concerned he
11:36
tried to play it off but he made it very
11:38
obvious that he was concerned about
11:39
something so now i'm like [ __ ] what's
11:41
going on because my friend about to like
11:42
introduce me to his like real girlfriend
11:44
or something like you know i'm thinking
11:45
about everything but
11:47
what happened i'm just chilling for like
11:49
an hour upstairs and eventually she
11:50
tells me okay we need to go downstairs
11:52
there's somebody that i want to
11:53
introduce you to which i'm excited i'm
11:55
like oh my god like i'm literally like
11:56
nervous sweating like oh my god like am
11:58
i gonna meet like like who is this am i
12:00
gonna get jumped like i don't know
12:02
waiting for us outside of the hotel
12:04
lobby is this older man and not like
12:06
older older as of like 80 90 i'm talking
12:08
about maybe like late 30s early 40s he's
12:11
in a big poncho he's like super wrapped
12:13
up big ass hat i'm like who is this man
12:15
like where did who is this man she's
12:17
just telling me like just play it cool
12:19
like just be nice to him like i'll let
12:21
you know everything afterwards i'm like
12:22
what the [ __ ] am i getting into like she
12:24
wants to bring him into my hotel room
12:26
like who is this man he's like you guys
12:27
want to smoke like we can go outside and
12:29
roll up and just walk around i'm like
12:30
who is this man but i kind of like you
12:32
already because you got what i like we
12:34
go outside we're just walking around the
12:36
hotel walking around you know like the
12:37
burbank glendale area
12:40
and just talking or whatever he was a
12:41
really really nice guy so i didn't have
12:44
any you know red flags or anything but
12:46
the same time i was like who is this guy
12:48
you know i'm just making small talk
12:50
telling him like a little bit of who i
12:51
am he's telling me that he's like an
12:53
entrepreneur and like tech and stuff and
12:55
he sold his company and he just kind of
12:57
chills every day because
12:59
he sold his company and he's sitting on
13:00
cash so i'm like oh good for you he only
13:02
stayed for maybe like 35 40 minutes like
13:05
literally came to smoke and then left
13:06
and i was like okay
13:08
what the [ __ ] was that keep in mind
13:10
before the guy showed up i smoked when
13:12
the guy showed up i smoked when he left
13:13
i smoked so i'm literally just fried out
13:15
of my mind like what the hell is going
13:17
on
13:18
i've been in so many random situations
13:20
so i don't even get scared anymore i'm
13:21
just kind of like
13:23
going with the flow of things and my
13:25
friend proceeds to tell me that that guy
13:27
is the one who
13:28
the person that i was talking to my
13:30
boyfriend quote unquote trying to be my
13:32
boy but he was telling me like leave
13:33
that ring finger empty i see you it's it
13:36
when i see you it's just us like you
13:38
know that whole conversation so she
13:40
basically tells me that that is the
13:41
person that he's been staying with this
13:42
entire time and i'm like okay how the
13:45
[ __ ] did you find him
13:46
like where like how even never explained
13:49
to me how she did this girl just had her
13:50
ways i genuinely do not know how she
13:53
found him to this day i don't know and i
13:55
can't get in connection with a man nor
13:57
would i want to
13:58
maybe she did some digging through his
14:00
photos and his followers and somehow
14:01
found him i legitimately cannot answer
14:04
it for you guys and i know some of you
14:05
are like that just doesn't make sense
14:06
like how i don't know she proceeds to
14:08

15:02

15:11
like like i said i'm trying out on my
15:12

15:43
still does hello there's like girl i'm
15:45
gonna need you to come back in the
15:46
morning because this is just
15:49
this isn't just this isn't processing
15:51
right walk her down to her car she ends
15:53
up leaving and i go back up into my room
15:55
and i'm just sitting there
15:57
just very very confused for the next
16:00
couple of hours at this point i decide
16:01
you know what even though i'm right out
16:03
of my mind and i'm probably gonna you
16:04
know
16:05
get caught up let me try to go around
16:07
the question and somehow get some
16:09
answers so i'm asking him stuff like
16:11
where exactly are you staying again what
16:13
city was zip code who were you staying
16:15
with um what's the name of the person
16:17
you're staying like just asking all
16:18
these questions and he's like why are
16:19
you like asking me all this stuff all of
16:21
a sudden like you didn't care i'm like
16:23
oh i don't know i'm just asking like i'm
16:24
wondering and he wouldn't give me an
16:26
answer kept going around like i'm just
16:27
staying with one of my friends i'm like
16:29
but who and he's like it doesn't matter
16:32
so of course i hung up the phone why is
16:33
this man lying to me like why won't he
16:35
just tell me he's with like that's the
16:37
reason our relationship ended in the
16:38
first place because there was no trust
16:40
because of what he did so i'm like why
16:42
are you like giving me the ring around
16:44
rosie i just end up cutting the convo
16:46
for that day because girl i had to wake
16:48
up early i had music that i wanted to be
16:50
i looked like darcy from darcy and stacy
16:53
if you know the show you know the show
16:55
so i just cut the combo for that day
16:56
because the next day i had things that i
16:58
had to work on like i had music i wanted
17:00
to make i had to be in the right mindset
17:02
like i had had people to see things to
17:04
do i couldn't be flustered most likely
17:06
gonna put a hat on so i'm not really
17:08
concerned about the top of this right
17:10
now finally i get out of the studio i'm
17:12
like you know what let me go ahead and
17:13
answer this man's call so i do and
17:15
immediately he's like yelling at me on
17:17
the phone like where are you like why

17:26
ex thought he could yell at me on the
17:28
phone from 2 000 miles away but you're
17:30
not about to do it from 30 miles down
17:31

17:54
to pull up by themselves it's just going
17:55
to be us you know to discuss everything
17:57
that's been going on because like i said
17:58
a [ __ ] has been feeling very lied to
18:00
you so
18:01
he pulls up and i'm thinking that he's
18:03
going to be by himself but of course he
18:04
brings his annoying ass friend this
18:06
friend like his claim to flame came to
18:08

18:11
la and telling people he had this song
18:13

18:15

18:16
that from the day that i met him like
18:19

18:26
like yeah that was interesting so i
18:29
don't know if he brought his friend to
18:30
try to like defuse something or try to
18:32
like distract me but i kid you not the
18:33
whole time his friend is just blabbing
18:35
blabbing vibing about this opportunity
18:37
and this and we should go get drinks and
18:38
we should pop bottles of ro
18:40
and then
18:41
what are you talking about and i'm just
18:42
looking at my boo like
18:45
like
18:47
like what's going on and i pulled him to
18:48
the side and i said i'm sorry but like
18:50
you need to stay here and i need to talk
18:51
to your homeboy so i pull him away we go
18:53
to the pool area and we're talking and
18:55
he basically is in denial about
18:57
everything all of a sudden him and his
18:58
friend have a party they gotta go to and
19:00
they leave why the [ __ ] did i even
19:02
answer his goddamn dm yearly or what the
19:04
[ __ ] is wrong with you vanessa like what
19:06
is wrong with you i can't remember which
19:07
holiday it was but i know it was during
19:09
the summer time and he's like oh i'm
19:10
going to fly you out like we're going to
19:11
do a bunch of like you know like
19:13
yachting and we're going to be on boat
19:14
so we're going to grill out it's going
19:16
to be a good time in my head i'm like
19:17
you know what it's an experience to go
19:19
and network i don't have any friends
19:20
right now let me go and try you know
19:22
social butterfly or something make some
19:24
connections he said it's going to be a
19:25
bunch of influencers models
19:28
investors like you know inventors
19:30
entrepreneurs so i'm thinking okay this
19:31
might be something i want to go to like
19:33
also for you know the connections so i
19:35
told him yeah i'm down to do it like
19:36
that could be fun i didn't really have
19:37
anything going on at the time so i told
19:40
him yes let's do that the whole texting
19:42
and facetiming thing happened for maybe
19:43
about a week and a half to two weeks and
19:45
then boom ghost again he unfollowed me
19:47
on everything so i'm like okay what's
19:49
going on because i'm supposed to be
19:50
flying out soon right i go and check his
19:52
instagram i don't see anything i go and
19:54
check twitter i don't find nothing i go
19:56
on his ticktalk account and he posts a
19:58
video with this really really pretty
19:59
girl like i'm not going to talk [ __ ] on
20:00
her like she's a really beautiful girl
20:02
um
20:03
and it's her like in the car with him
20:05
and he's like oh i love my girlfriend
20:06
road tripping with my girlfriend
20:11
i'm just sitting there like damn
20:13
play it again [ __ ]
20:15
how you let the same person play that
20:17
many times i let him know that i saw
20:20
everything i saw and he's a piece of
20:21
[ __ ] and never hit me up again and
20:24
that's that i mean a couple months later
20:25
i did end up meeting anthony so i would
20:27
have had no reason to end up you know
20:30
talking to this person again but
20:33
i was just like really again bamboozled
20:35
so ladies and gentlemen i guess like the
20:37
lesson like there's always a lesson at
20:39
the end of my story times right so this
20:41
lesson would be if people show you who
20:43
they are
20:44
the first
20:45
and the second time because i know that
20:47
um
20:49
why is she all the way up there
20:51
oh my god i don't like the way it's
20:52
making my head look very oblong so i
20:54
think i said i guess the lesson is if
20:55
someone shows you who they are one time
20:58
and two times because if you're a
20:59
forgiving [ __ ] like me if they show you
21:00
literally the second time who they are
21:02
and you still look past it then
21:06
i i don't know what to tell you at that
21:08
point you're just playing yourself
21:11
yeah
21:12
that's it for today's video if you
21:13
enjoyed the story and my misery
21:16
subscribe i tell a lot of story times on
21:18
