{"prompt": "spirit flight attendant screamed at me", "completion": " Wait wait wait wait! Before you unsubscribe. (laughing) I'm dyeing it back in two weeks, okay? I feel like before I even get into the video I have to address the fact that I have pink hair I don't know, I've always, always wanted pink hair. Like, my entire life, I've wanted to just do it once, I wanted to just say \"fuck it\". I don't want it to be any other hair color, because I know it's not going to look good. Blonde me is a thing. I look like Michael Jackson with any other hair color. It's like, holiday break right now. I have to grow out my hair anyways 'cause of my scalp \u2014 just Tana things, Tana problems. I can't bleach my scalp until January, right before I go on tour, so I've been having to grow out my roots, and I was like, \"you know what while I have roots and while I'm not doing anything to my hair, I'm just going to say fuck it, and I'm going to dye it pink.\" So I took my happy ass to Hot Topic today. -laughing- and I bought some pink hair dye and now my hair is pink. I did it myself also to my hairdresser you don't know this is happening. You might be watching this I'm really sorry. I just know she is mad. She is going to deck me in the fucking face. Next time she see me. She always tells me to never do anything to my hair. But yeah, it's semi-permanent and as soon as I go back blonde for tour, like, in a month or so I'll be blonde again. So I thought for a month I would have pink hair, and I'm not going to lie I really fucking like it. And I'm really really really proud of myself for doing something I said I was never going to do. Jumping out of my fucking ultimate comfort zone. My ultimate comfort zone is my blonde hair. I'm not even kidding you. That's the one thing that I, like, consider my comfort zone. So the fact that I have pink hair and I dig it is really fucking cool. Wise words of my mother who actually gave birth to me, I actually came out of her pussy, Jenna Marbles, \"life is way too fucking short not to have fun ass hair\", so here I am, with fun, pink hair! If you're gonna unsubscribe 'cause my hair's not blonde anymore, just wait a month just days, like, whatever, like, like me for my personality. Go look at my old videos. Like, if you're a guy and you're new here, like, and you'd pipe blonde me, just, like, go watch those videos. Wait a month, okay? So now [laughs]. Hi guys, it's Tana Mongeau, and I don't know if you guys know this \u2014 if you know me, you know this \u2014 I fly so much. I just got back from the airport, probably, like, hours ago, and I'm leaving for the airport again in, like,"}
